    <name>Fey Charm (3/Day)</name>
    <text>A humanoid or beast within 30 feet makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it is magically charmed. While charmed in this way  the target regards the dryad as a trusted ally and is disposed to interpret the dryads requests and actions favorably. The creature can repeat this saving throw if the dryad or the dryads allies harm it  ending the effect on a success. Otherwise  the effect lasts 24 hours. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw against Fey Charm or the effect ends for it  it is immune to Fey Charm for 24 hours.</text>
