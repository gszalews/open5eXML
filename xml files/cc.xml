    <name>Clockwork Encasement</name>
    <text>The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a variety of manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. When the ahu-nixta is reduced to 0 hp, its clockwork armor breaks and the ahunixta exits it. Once out of its armor, the creature's pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.

Without its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta's body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can't be used for combat. The ahu-nixta's extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.

The ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action.</text>

A creature being dragged by the ahuizotl makes attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage.

If the target is an object or weapon being held by another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw, or the ahuizotl pulls the object away from the creature. After stealing an object or weapon, the ahuizotl can move up to its speed as a bonus action. The ahuizotl can only grapple one creature or hold one weapon or object at a time.

The released creature falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the alabaster tree. If the alabaster tree dies, an engulfed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the leaves and branches by using an action to untangle itself.</text>

Brimstone: The golem takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem can breathe poison as an action. In addition, any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the golem must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn.
Quicksilver: The golem takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem's silver hide turns to shifting quicksilver, increasing its speed to 40 feet and granting it resistance to damage to which it is not already immune. l
Salt: The golem takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem's silver hide is covered with salt crystals, increasing its AC by 3. The golem's slam attacks deal an extra 14 (4d6) piercing damage and the ground within 20 feet of the golem becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour.

    <name>Astral Devour</name>
    <text>A creature hosting an astral snapper's astral form must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw each time it finishes a long rest. On a success, the astral snapper is ejected from the host and the Astral Plane into an unoccupied space in the Material Plane within 10 feet of the host and is stunned for 1 round. On a failure, the astral snapper consumes part of the host's internal organs, reducing the host's Constitution score by 1d4. The host dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. The reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the astral snapper has been expelled. If the host's Constitution score is reduced to 0, the astral snapper exits the host's body in the Material Plane by tearing its way out through the abdomen. The astral snapper becomes completely corporeal as it exits the host, stepping out of the host at its full size.

From the time the astral snapper succeeds on the initial dive into the host through the Astral Plane until the moment it emerges from the host's abdomen, it can be seen by any creature that can see into the Astral Plane-its head buried in the host's back. The astral snapper has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and is effectively stunned when in this position until it takes damage.</text>

If the saving throw is successful, the creature is pushed out of the elemental's space. The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time.

At the start of the elemental's turn, each target grappled by it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing a grappled creature on a success. When Blood Drain deals 30 or more necrotic damage, the elemental grows in size as though affected by an enlarge/reduce spell. This increase in size lasts until the blood elemental finishes a long rest.</text>

Vaporize. A red mist surrounds the blood giant in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The mist spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It moves with the blood giant and doesn't impede the giant's vision. The mist dissipates after 1d4 rounds.</text>

    <text>The golem makes a slam attack against a target it is grappling as it opens a plate in its chest and exposes its arcane boiler. If the attack hits, the target is forced into the golem's boiler, and the grapple ends. While inside the boiler, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the boiler, and it takes 14 (4d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. To escape, it or another creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to open the boiler, freeing the target, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the golem. A bronze golem can only have one creature in its boiler at a time.</text>

This works like the clairvoyance spell, except the most recent owner is the sensor and controls which direction it is pointed, how far it can see, etc. The most recent owner must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it gets the sensation that it is being watched.

A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the mist enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist's turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn't move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist. Doing so requires a DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The mist can only engulf one Medium or smaller creature at a time.</text>

    <text>When the dream squire's master is targeted by an attack or spell, the squire magically teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the master, and the attack or spell targets the squire instead. If the attack or spell deals damage, the dream squire takes half damage from it. To use this ability, the master and squire must be on the same plane.</text>

The charmed target can't take reactions and obeys the fierstjerren's verbal and telepathic commands. A fierstjerren can have up to twelve charmed thralls at one time. A charmed thrall loses the memories of its previous life and devotes itself to the fierstjerren and the cult. The charm lasts for 24 hours or until the fierstjerren is destroyed, is more than 300 feet from the charmed target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. The fierstjerren can attempt to reassert control over all of its thralls by using this action. Each thrall can repeat the saving throw when the fierstjerren uses this action to reassert control.</text>

    <text>When a creature that can see the fulad-zereh's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the demon, the fulad-zereh can force it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the demon isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the saving throw begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the demon until the start of its next turn, when it can avert is eyes again. If the creature looks at the demon, it must immediately make the save.</text>

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the bowl. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. 

On a failed save, the bowl enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage at the start of each of the bowl's turns. When the bowl moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. 

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the bowl.</text>

    <name>Burrowing Roots</name>
    <text>Whenever the jinmenju makes a root attack, it can choose a point on the ground within 120 feet of it. The root bursts from the ground, and that point becomes the attack's point of origin. After attacking, the exposed root protrudes from that point, and the jinmenju gains a reaction each turn that it can only use to make an opportunity attack with that root. A root has AC 15, 45 hp, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Damaging a root doesn't damage the jinmenju tree. The jinmenju can have up to 5 roots active at one time. If it makes a root attack while it has 5 roots active, one of the active roots burrows back into the ground and a new root appears at the location of the new attack.</text>

    <name>Grave Pox</name>
    <text>A creature infected with grave pox becomes vulnerable to necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured. Additionally, the creature cannot reduce its exhaustion by finishing a long rest. The infected creature is highly contagious. Each creature that touches it, or that is within 10 feet of it when it finishes a long rest, must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or also contract grave pox. 

When an infected creature finishes a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. As the disease progresses, the infected creature becomes weaker and develops painful green pustules all over its skin. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. The cured creature is no longer vulnerable to necrotic damage and can remove exhaustion levels as normal.</text>

  <trait>
    <name>Necrotic Regeneration</name>
    <text>While attached to a living host, a necrotic tick leaks negative energy into the host's bloodstream, quickly closing over the creature's wounds with scabrous, necrotic flesh. If the host doesn't already have regeneration, it regains 2 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. Track how many “necrotic hp” a host recovers via Necrotic Regeneration. Magical healing reverses the necrosis and subtracts an equal number of necrotic hp from those accumulated. When the necrotic hp equal the host's hit point maximum, the host becomes a zombie.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Ride Host</name>
    <text>When a necrotic tick's living host has lost three-quarters of its maximum hp from Blood Drain, the tick's toxins fill the host with an unnatural desire to approach other living beings. When a suitable creature is within 5 feet, the tick incites a sudden rage in the host, riding the current host to a new host. The current host must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it attempts to grapple a living creature within 5 feet of it as a reaction. The host can re-attempt this saving throw at the end of each turn that it suffers damage from the necrotic tick's Blood Drain.</text>
  </trait>
  <action>
    <name>Blood Drain</name>
    <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the tick attaches to the target. While attached, the necrotic tick doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the tick's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it is affected by the tick's toxins and doesn't attempt to remove the tick. The host will even replace a dislodged tick unless prevented from doing so for 1 minute, after which the tick's influence fades. 

The tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so when seeking a new host or if the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the tick. When a necrotic tick detaches, voluntarily or otherwise, its host takes 1 necrotic damage.</text>

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neophron, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neophron's turns. 

The neophron can only swallow one creature at a time. If a humanoid dies while swallowed, it transforms into a ghast. At the start of its next turn, the neophron regurgitates the ghast into an unoccupied space within 10 feet. The ghast is under the neophron's control and acts immediately after the neophron in the initiative count. 

If the neophron takes 20 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, the neophron must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the neophron. If the neophron dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

Creatures entirely inside the darkness are deafened and can't cast spells that include a verbal component. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is destroyed.</text>

    <text>The dragon is magically bound to three circlets. As long as the dragon is within 1 mile of a circlet wearer on the same plane of existence, the wearer can communicate telepathically with the dragon. While the dragon is active, the wearers see through its eyes and hear what it hears. During this time, the wearers are deaf and blind with regard to their own senses. 

If only two circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the active dragon, each hour spent wearing the circlets imposes one level of exhaustion on those wearers. If only a single wearer is within 1 mile of the active dragon, each minute spent wearing the circlet gives that wearer one level of exhaustion. If no circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the dragon, it views all creatures it can see as enemies and tries to destroy them until a circlet wearer communicates with the dragon or the dragon is destroyed. A circlet wearer can use its action to put the dragon in an inactive state where it becomes incapacitated until a wearer uses an action to switch the dragon to active. 

Each circlet is a magic item that must be attuned.</text>

    <text>The pillar of lost magocracy unleashes a random magical attack on a target or area within 120 feet. Roll a d4 to determine the effect:
1. Mutant Plants. Grasping tendrils of alien vegetation sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the pillar can see within 120 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained. Treat as an entangle spell, except it only lasts for 2d4 rounds.
2. Acid Rain. Corrosive acid falls from the sky centered on a point the pillar can see within 120 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3. Noxious Cloud. The pillar creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of reddish, stinging mist centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The area is heavily obscured, and each creature inside the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is blinded until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. The cloud lasts for 1d4 rounds.
4. Shrinking Ray. A bright green ray strikes a single creature within 120 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be shrunk to half its size. Treat as an enlarge/reduce spell, except it lasts for 2d4 rounds.</text>

    <text>One humanoid that the pishacha can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be possessed by the pishacha; the pishacha then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses some control of its body, succumbing to a random short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1) each round for 3d6 rounds. At the end of the 3d6 rounds, the pishacha becomes dormant within the body. 

While possessing a victim, the pishacha attempts to seize control of the body again every 1d4 hours. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to another 3d6 round period of random short-term madness. Even if the target succeeds, it is still possessed. If the target is still possessed at the end of a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness. 

While possessing a victim, the pishacha can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except those that can turn or repel fiends, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. 

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hp, the pishacha ends it as a bonus action, or the pishacha is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. The pishacha can also be forced out if the victim eats a bowl of rice that has been cooked in holy water. When the possession ends, the pishacha reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. 

The target is immune to possession by the same pishacha for 24 hours after succeeding on the initial saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

    <name>Dark Ground</name>
    <text>As an action, the razorleaf can dig its roots into the ground, securing itself in place and causing the area in a 20-foot radius around it to be shrouded in shadow. While rooted in this way, the razorleaf's speed becomes 0, it can't be knocked prone, and its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. This area is difficult terrain and nonmagical sources of light are only half as effective while within it. Small and smaller beasts with Intelligence 3 or lower in the area lose their natural coloration and turn pale grey. These creatures are charmed by the razorleaf while within the area. Plants and trees inside the area turn an ashen color. The razorleaf can recall its roots and end this effect as a bonus action.</text>

    <name>Seductive Gaze</name>
    <text>When a humanoid that can see the serpentine lamia's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the serpentine lamia, the serpentine lamia can force it to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw if the serpentine lamia isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the creature fails, it is charmed for 1 minute. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the serpentine lamia's Seductive Gaze for the next 24 hours. 

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the serpentine lamia until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the serpentine lamia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

  <trait>
    <name>Lantern's Light</name>
    <text>As a bonus action, the spirit lamp can open or close its lantern. When open, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The spirit lamp can only see objects within the lantern's light and is blind while the lantern is closed. The lantern's light pierces magical and nonmagical darkness and can't be dispelled by magical darkness. If a creature dies in the lantern's light, its spirit is trapped in the lantern.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Lantern Spirits</name>
    <text>Spirits of creatures that died within the lantern's light haunt it. While the lantern is open, these spirits surround the spirit lamp, slowing and attacking all creatures within the lantern's light. A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the spirit lamp has its speed halved and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spirit lamp dies and the lantern is open, the lantern's spirits continue to harm creatures within 30 feet of it until the lantern is destroyed or closed.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Spirit Lantern</name>
    <text>The spirit lamp's lantern is immune to damage and can't be the target of spells or effects as long as the spirit lamp lives. When the spirit lamp dies, the lantern floats gently to the ground and opens, if it was closed. The lantern has AC 17, 50 hp, and is immune to piercing, poison, and psychic damage. A creature that touches the lantern must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. A cursed creature is frightened of darkness, can't see anything outside of the lantern's light, and is unable to drop the lantern. The cursed creature will risk its own life to protect the lantern. A creature can repeat the saving throw each day at dawn, lifting the curse and ending the effects on itself on a success. If this occurs, the lantern disintegrates. After three failed saving throws, remove curse or similar magic is required to end the curse. 

If the creature remains cursed after 30 days, it is irreversibly changed by the curse, and it becomes the lantern's new spirit lamp. Voluntarily opening the lantern counts as a failed saving throw. If the lantern is destroyed, all captured spirits are put to rest and the cursed bearer, if it has not yet changed into a spirit lamp, is freed of the curse.</text>

On a failure, a creature becomes charmed until the start of its next turn. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated as it suffers from surreal hallucinations and must move up to its speed closer to the raptor that charmed it. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the sunset raptor, a target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Other sunset raptors are immune to this effect. 

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the sunset raptor until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the sunset raptor in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

    <name>Bound</name>
    <text>The dragon is magically bound to three circlets. As long as the dragon is within 1 mile of a circlet wearer on the same plane of existence, the wearer can communicate telepathically with the dragon. While the dragon is active, the wearers see through its eyes and hear what it hears. During this time, the wearers are deaf and blind with regard to their own senses. 

If only two circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the active dragon each hour spent wearing the circlets imposes one level of exhaustion on those wearers. If only a single wearer is within 1 mile of the active dragon, each minute spent wearing the circlet gives that wearer one level of exhaustion. If no circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the dragon, it views all creatures it can see as enemies and tries to destroy them until a circlet wearer communicates with the dragon or the dragon is destroyed. A circlet wearer can use its action to put the dragon in an inactive state where it becomes incapacitated until a wearer uses an action to switch the dragon to active. 

Each circlet is a magic item that must be attuned.</text>

On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't go berserk. On each of its turns, a berserk creature must attack the nearest creature it can see, eschewing ranged or magical attacks in favor of melee attacks. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the berserk creature attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once a creature goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is unconscious, regains all of its hp, or is cured through lesser restoration or similar magic.</text>

    <name>Telepathic Foresight</name>
    <text>As a bonus action at the start of its turn, the ziphius can choose one creature within 120 feet that it can see. The ziphius' eyes glow, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or the ziphius creates a temporary mental bond with the target until the start of the ziphius' next turn. While bonded, the ziphius reads the creature's surface thoughts, choosing to either gain advantage on attacks against that target or cause the target to have disadvantage on attacks against the ziphius.</text>

    <name>Beak</name>
    <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the ziphius. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ziphius, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the ziphius' turns. The ziphius can have only one target swallowed at a time. 

If the ziphius takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the ziphius must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ziphius. If the ziphius dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

The gate lasts 1 hour; though, the zoryas can choose to close it at any time as a bonus action. Once the gate closes, the zoryas is reduced to 0 hp and remains unconscious for six days, awakening, fully restored, at sunrise on the seventh day. The zoryas can't pass through its own gate.</text>
