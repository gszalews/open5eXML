    <name>Fear of Fire</name>
    <text>The a-mi-kuk is afraid of fire, and it won’t move toward any fiery or burning objects. If presented forcefully with a flame, or if it is dealt fire damage, the a-mi-kuk must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. After it has been frightened by a specific source of fire (such as the burning hands spell), the a-mi-kuk can’t be frightened by that same source again for 24 hours.</text>

    <name>Icy Slime</name>
    <text>The a-mi-kuk’s body is covered in a layer of greasy, ice-cold slime that grants it the benefits of freedom of movement. In addition, a creature that touches the a-mi-kuk or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage from the freezing slime.

    <name>Strangle</name>
    <text>The a-mi-kuk strangles one creature grappled by it. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, can’t breathe, speak, or cast spells, and begins suffocating. On a success, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and is no longer grappled. Until this strangling grapple ends (escape DC 16), the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The a-mi-kuk can strangle up to two Medium or smaller targets or one Large target at a time.</text>

  <description>Crimson slime covers this ungainly creature. Its tiny black eyes sit in an abnormally large head, and dozens of sharp teeth fill its small mouth. Its limbs end in large, grasping claws that look strong enough to crush the life out of a bear._   **Hidden Terror.** The dreaded a-mi-kuk is a terrifying creature that feasts on any who venture into the bleak and icy expanses of the world. A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.   **Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.   **Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe’s size or power.</description>

  <description>A chimeric beast with the body of a massive trout and the front claws and head of a fierce wolverine bursts up from the icy water. Its eyes glow with a lambent green light, and the air around it bends and distorts as if viewed through a thick lens._   **Hungry Lake Monsters.** The aalpamac is a dangerous freshwater predator native to lakes and rivers. While primarily a water-dwelling monster, the aalpamac can haul itself onto shore with its front claws and does so to attack prey drinking or moving at the water’s edge. While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.   **Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as “Chompo” or “the Heron Lake Monster.” These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.</description>

  <description>This giant has a bulky, muscular body and small eyes in its broad, flat face. The giant’s thumbs end in large, black claws._   **Ancient Giants of the Deep.** Abbanith giants are among the oldest races of giants known to exist and are said to have been around since the world was first formed. Many scholars turn to the giants’ deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.   **Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants’ unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.   **Allies of the Earth.** For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the Open Game License</description>

  <description>Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._   **Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.   **Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License</description>

  <description>The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._   **Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.   **Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.   **Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License</description>

    <name>Clockwork Encasement</name>
    <text>The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a variety of manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. When the ahu-nixta is reduced to 0 hp, its clockwork armor breaks and the ahu-nixta exits it. Once out of its armor, the creature’s pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.

Without its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta’s body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can’t be used for combat. The ahu-nixta’s extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.

  <description>A cloud of unconnected, flat gray triangles in the vague shape of a mantis flickers unpredictably from one position to another, clicking softly as its arm blades swing outward. Akaasits are constructed beings from a plane destroyed by a catastrophic misuse of time magic. They were altered by this catastrophe and now exist in the present and in fractions of a second in the past and future._   **Mindless.** The akaasit has no mind, at least as understood by denizens of the Material Plane, and its motives are inscrutable. Each akaasit is always found moving toward some unknown destination. It may attack other creatures, or it may ignore them. It protects itself if attacked, but rarely does an akaasit pursue a retreating foe.   **Unknown Origin.** The home of the akaasit is unknown, but they are often encountered in areas touched or altered by time magic. Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit’s demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.   **Dispersed Destruction.** If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles. These triangles fade out of existence over the next ten minutes, leaving only the akaasit’s two armblades.   **Construct Nature.** The akaasit doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>Possessing the body, head, and tail of a killer whale and the powerful legs of a huge wolf, the akhlut is the alpha predator of the polar landscape. Truly personifying the term “seawolf,” these intelligent and resilient creatures travel freely between the land and sea in search of prey._   Akhluts are the masters of their domain. Though they have been seen across all of the world’s oceans and many of its coastlines, akhluts are most comfortable in cold regions with easy access to the sea. Because their pods can reach almost a dozen members, anything is fair game from reindeer and seals to mammoths and whales. The only beings powerful enough, or foolhardy enough, to evict a pod of akhluts from their territory are dragons and other akhluts.   **Playful Predators.** Akhluts possess undeniable cunning and inquisitiveness, with no two pods using the same strategies to solve problems or hunt prey. Easily bored, akhluts crave stimulation and are known to follow ships and caravans for miles in the hopes that someone might provide something new or exciting to experience. They can be especially mischievous, freeing fish and game from traps purely to hunt he creatures themselves.   **Dangerous Steeds.** The akhlut’s natural power, intelligence, and versatility make them incredibly desirable mounts, but the effort to tame one of these creatures is dangerous and not to be taken lightly. Even akhluts who have been mounts for years are willful enough to assert themselves from time to time. With a great deal of patience and a little luck, akhluts can become fiercely loyal and protective companions.</description>

1. Pleasant Mist. The skunk produces a rosy mist. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of its next turn.
2. Shrinking Cloud. The skunk releases a yellow gas. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be reduced as if targeted by the enlarge/reduce spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

4. Blinding Spray. The skunk shoots a stream of a green fluid. Each creature in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute, or until the creature uses an action to wipe its eyes.
5. Sleeping Fog. The skunk sprays a sweet-smelling blue fog. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
6. Poison Fog. The skunk excretes a foul-smelling purple fog around itself until the start of its next turn. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.</text>

  <description>The large skunk waddles forward, sniffing at a spilled potion. As a sound nearby startles it, the skunk raises its tail, and the stripes on its back change color._   **Magical Prank.** The unfortunate result of a magic school prank, alchemical skunks were created when an ordinary skunk was forced to drink a combination of potions. Despite their larger size, alchemical skunks still look and act like ordinary skunks, except for the ever-changing color of the stripes on their backs. Experienced foresters know that the colors on the alchemical skunk’s back indicate which magical malady the creature is about to spray and do their best to avoid aggravating these dangerous creatures.   **Laboratory Pests.** Alchemical skunks forage the same as their nonmagical kin, but they are also regularly found scavenging the waste of alchemical laboratories. They enjoy feasting on potions and potion components, much to the dismay of alchemists and adventurers alike.</description>

  <description>A fish as large as a rowboat serenely floats beneath the surface of the water, its flowing fins and iridescent scales shimmering in the waves. When disturbed, it attacks with a ferocity unexpected of such a delicate-looking creature._   Alpha fish are solitary and extremely territorial creatures. They are always found alone, except during the few short weeks of mating season each year when schools of the fish gather.   **Dazzling Dominance.** Before attacking, alpha fish often attempt to intimidate potential rivals or predators away by flaring their colorful fins to make themselves appear much larger. If successful, they usually refrain from attacking.   **Aggressive.** If intimidation doesn’t work, alpha fish defend their chosen homes by viciously attacking. They have been known to attack creatures much larger than themselves and, occasionally, objects they don’t recognize.   **Valuable.** Many aristocrats seek the beautiful, shimmering fish as pets in massive, personal aquariums, and the alpha fish’s scales are valuable spell components.</description>

  <description>Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._   **Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.   **Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License</description>

  <description>The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._   **Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.   **Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.   **Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License</description>

  <description>A gold-furred, lion-headed angel with white wings gives an intense stare, releasing a roar as it raises a flaming greatsword._   Angelic enforcers are lion-headed celestials that hunt rogue angels.   **Divine Mission.** Angelic enforcers are made from souls selected for their unwavering adherence to the tenants of law and good. These elite angels have a special task: police other angels that go rogue. If an angel breaks one of its god’s tenets but remains good at heart, the enforcers usually only seek to capture the offending celestial to stand trial in the upper planes. If an angel becomes fully corrupted by evil, one or more enforcers are sent to destroy the fallen celestial.   **Nothing Gets in the Way.** Angelic enforcers show no mercy to any creature or obstacle between them and their quarries. Those who obstruct the enforcers stand in the way of divine justice and are therefore considered agents of evil. Any killings or collateral damage done by enforcers are usually seen as the fault of their quarry for stepping out of line in the first place.   **Immortal Nature.** An angelic enforcer doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The ogre shifts and contorts, dropping to all fours as it takes the form of a vicious bear-sized skunk with razor-sharp claws and teeth._   **Noxious Terrors.** The aniwye is a magical monstrosity that resembles a cross between an enormous skunk and a wolverine. They go out of their way to hunt humans and gnomes, particularly those tied to the natural world. Aside from their savage claws and teeth, the aniwye can also spray a deadly musk at opponents, the poison burning the eyes and lungs of those who inhale it. Aniwye also use this musk to mark their territory—a tree trunk or boulder covered in fresh musk is a sure sign an aniwye is not far away.   **Unsubtle Shapeshifters.** Aniwye can shapeshift into an Open Game License</description>

  <description>Thick desert grit encrusts a decayed form as it stalks forward, clouds of biting sand flitting about at its behest._   Apaxrusl, or sand drudges, are created through dark rituals that merge a corpse with desert sand.   **Soul Infusion.** The rituals used to create an apaxrusl call for infusing damned souls into the sand, and would-be creators regularly make bargains with demons to acquire this unique component. Oftentimes, the deal goes poorly for the creator, leaving the resulting apaxrusl to wander the desert without a master.   **Abyssal Intelligence.** The damned souls filling the apaxrusl give it intelligence, but its constructed form keeps it loyal, making it a valuable asset to its creator. Necromancers often create apaxrusl to lead small groups of undead on specific tasks, confident in the construct’s ability to execute orders and lead the undead while away from the direct control of the necromancer.   **Construct Nature.** The apaxrusl doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A portly gentleman with slender arms and legs keeps his face and hands carefully concealed._   Arachnocrats are spider-like fiends who enjoy masquerading as members of high society. They eat haute cuisine and drink fine wine in the company of humans.   **Finer Tastes.** Viewing the wealth and standing of their victims as the greatest measure of taste, these devils delight in aristocratic prey, though they most often feed on the liquefied innards of servants of the aristocracy to avoid detection. They use local spiders as spies and informants to get closer to their quarries or discover dark secrets their quarries would rather keep hidden. Ever patient in their schemes of corruption, arachnocrats often court their quarries over months of theatre, dinner parties, and elaborate balls.   **Hidden in Plain Sight.** Arachnocrats are adept at disguising themselves as aristocrats. Their most noticeable features are their clawed hands and their spider-like faces, which they cover with gloves, masks, scarves, voluminous robes, and similar attire. The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.   **As Good As Gold.** The arachnocrat’s preferred prey comes at a high price. Blessed by the Arch-Devil of Greed, Mammon, arachnocrats have a second stomach that can turn common rocks into faux gemstones. The fiends vomit up the gemstones after digesting the rocks for a few months, and they use the gemstones to fund their endeavors. The counterfeit nature of the gems is detectable by only true craftsmen.</description>

The astral devourer has a hive mind made up of all the minds of its component creatures and possesses a great cunning that makes it more adept at hunting.   **All for the Whole.** The individual astral serpents that make up the astral devourer have no thoughts or wills of their own, and the collective freely uses the individuals as weapons. The astral devourer often flings serpents at hard-to-reach prey to consume it. The flung serpents return to the astral devourer, bringing the consumed life force back to the collective. When food is particularly scarce or the devourer is in danger, it can split into subgroups of the main collective, feeding the individuals while keeping the whole safely dispersed.   **Planar Hunters.** Hunger constantly drives astral devourers. They love the taste of sentient planar travelers, and they roam the multiverse, favoring desolate landscapes. Reports indicate they’re adept at finding portals between worlds and relentlessly hunt prey through these portals.</description>

  <description>Human hands sit at the ends of the raccoon-headed creature’s four short legs. It flicks its banded tail as it turns toward cries for help, setting its vivid blue eyes on those in need._   **Good Samaritans.** Astri range the badlands and deserts of the Material Plane, seeking opportunities to assist lost and dying travelers. When an astri encounters people in distress, it works to grant them the assistance they need—be it food, healing, or a safe place to rest—and remains until they no longer require its help.   **Bringers of Hope.** When they aren’t helping individuals or small groups, astri quietly watch over villages in their territories. They keep the surroundings clear of threats, aerate the soil, and dig out wells in places with limited access to clean water. Astri become quite fond of the settlements under their protection and take pride in the residents’ successes.   **Enemies of Greed.** Mercenary behavior offends the sensibilities of astri, but they understand many people have strong selfish streaks. Astri counter this selfishness by magically enforcing the desire to help others. Before an astri assists an intelligent creature, it asks the creature to promise to do good deeds over the next few weeks. If a creature won’t make the promise, the astri still assists, but the creature must contend with the _geas_ that may be attached to the helping hand.</description>

They hate other creatures just as much and despise everything that is beautiful and pure in the world.   **Poisonous Fey.** Attercroppes radiate supernatural poison from their bodies. While their poisonous aura cannot harm living creatures directly, it is remarkably good at poisoning fresh sources of drinking water, such as wells and ponds. Rivers, streams, and lakes are usually too large for a single attercroppe to poison, but several attercroppes working together can poison a larger body of still or slow-moving water.   **Fey Enemies.** Water-dwelling fey, such as Open Game License</description>

  <description>An amalgam of various bird species crows proudly as it hops forward._   **Chimeric Avian.** The body of an august rooster is nearly human-sized with the head of a pheasant, the body of a perching duck, the tail of a peacock, the legs of a heron, the beak of a parrot, and the wings of a swallow. There is wide variation among specimens of this hybrid, however, with different creators replacing portions of the creature depending on the material they have on hand during the creation process. Most august roosters are created entirely of avian material, though specimens evidencing snake necks, turtle shells, and stag bodies have been encountered. Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird. Only three percent of eggs fertilized or laid by an august rooster hatch into another august rooster. An august rooster fused by magic is full grown at creation, while one that hatches naturally grows to adulthood over the span of six to eight months.   **Selfish and Self-serving.** August roosters display the basest instincts of their creators, and they have the mental faculties and temperament of a spoiled, malicious child. Their sole concern is their own comfort, and they use their natural gifts to force nearby humanoids to tend to their wants and needs. Young august roosters are brazen about their collections of servants, often working the servants to exhaustion with constant demands. More mature individuals have a strong sense of self-preservation and have their servants see to their needs only when they know it will not raise suspicion.</description>

  <trait>
    <name>Reality Adjacent</name>
    <text>The aurora horribilis does not fully exist in physical space. If the aurora is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. In addition, attack rolls against it have disadvantage. A creature with truesight doesn’t have disadvantage on its attack rolls, but if that creature looks at the aurora, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated with a speed of 0 for 1 minute. An incapacitated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

    <text>The aurora horribilis creates a dissonant song.

This song has no effect on constructs, undead, or creatures that can speak or understand Void Speech. The aurora must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the aurora is incapacitated.

While charmed by the aurora, the target suffers the effects of the confusion spell and hums along with the maddening tune. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this aurora’s song for the next 24 hours. A target that stays charmed by the aurora’s song for more than 1 minute gains one long-term madness.</text>

  <description>A ribbon of light flies just above the ground, its gleam flickering in and out of view as it emits a discordant tune._   **Hidden Among Polar Lights.** Though auroras horribilis can manifest anywhere on a world, they prefer to dance and sing within naturally-occurring auroras. When they notice admirers of boreal lights, they descend from the sky to share their songs. Unfortunately, they are unaware of the bewilderment their songs invoke in listeners and are subsequently surprised by hostile action toward them.   **Terrible Harbinger.** While an aurora’s direct effects on most creatures is cause for alarm, the aurora’s presence is typically a prelude to something worse. Auroras tend to attach themselves to the forefront of a wave of devastation wrought by unknowable beings. Given the nature of such beings, auroras can precede the beings by days or even centuries.   **Lessons from the Void.** Because auroras horribilis travel with ancient beings from the Void, they hear many secrets about the universe, which they incorporate into their songs. An inability to understand the incomprehensible knowledge contained in their songs often induces madness in their listeners. This makes the auroras valuable to apocalypse cults welcoming the beings they herald, as well as to the desperate who seek to avert the coming catastrophe.</description>

  <description>Ice shards scrape together as this creature moves on its many icicle-like legs. The ice making up much of its body parts to reveal several toothy maws, and a scream erupts from deep within the creature._   **Primordial Beings.** Avalanche screamers were apex predators when the world was younger and covered in ice. As the world thawed, avalanche screamers fled to mountain peaks and polar regions to hunt smaller prey. Avalanche screamer lairs contain a jumble of bones from their victims but have no other commonalities.   **Devious Hunter.** A versatile predator, the avalanche screamer can attack its prey from the ground beneath or from cliffs and trees above. It prefers to pick off its victims one at a time, grabbing stragglers at the back of a group and killing them before returning to the group. When it must face multiple foes simultaneously, it uses its scream to inflict harm on as many targets as possible. In unstable areas, the sound can cause avalanches, which the avalanche screamer rides out unscathed. It then uses its ability to detect vibrations to locate survivors, tunnel its way toward them, and devour them.   **Summer Hibernation.** Because avalanche screamers become lethargic and vulnerable in warmer temperatures, they hide themselves during the brief summers in their mountaintop and polar habitats. In preparation for their summer slumbers, they aggressively hunt prey, fattening themselves or stockpiling in their lairs. As a precaution against hunters that might follow them to their lairs, avalanche screamers often collect their food from miles away and tunnel through the ground to leave no tracks. Those who manage to track the creatures and hope to easily dispatch them while they are sluggish find avalanche screamers quickly shake their torpor to defend themselves.</description>

They dislike leaving the area they were sent to tend, but they sometimes venture out to heal or evangelize passersby.   **Songbirds.** Locations containing avieres are always filled with beautiful music, as they sing the hymns of their deities at all hours of the day. In doing so, they heal and uplift their surroundings, leading to healthier flora and fauna and calmer weather in the area.   **Temple Assistants.** Avieres in temples spend most days aiding the temple’s priests and priestesses, especially in coaching acolytes or those new to the faith. They take great pleasure in assisting scribes who are writing their deity’s teachings, acting as a light source while singing the teachings to the scribes.</description>

  <description>A muscular humanoid with gray-black skin and the oversized head of a donkey lumbers forward. The monster’s eyes and tongue loll from its head, and its arms end in crimson crab-like pincers that snap together with incredible strength._   **Tormented Killers.** A baliri demon is created when a humanoid suffers at the hands of family or peers and turns to one of the demon lords for succor and bloody retribution. The result is both catastrophic and deadly, and the victim of the abuse is often executed for their dark dealings. It is at this moment that the demon lord snatches up the victim’s soul and transforms it into a baliri demon, a savage and remorseless killer that seeks to spread misery in its wake.   **Braying Apostles.** A baliri demon is a devout servant of the demon lord that created it, stridently extolling the virtues of its demonic master even as it butchers and defiles anyone who stands in its way. The loud braying prayers and hymns of a baliri demon carry for miles across the blasted Abyssal landscape and fill the hearts of mortals and lesser demons alike with dread. Baliri demons are not picky when it comes to choosing their victims but have a preference for anyone who resembles an aggressor from their previous life.</description>

  <description>Honed by evolutionary processes, the balloon spider has perfected the art of ballooning, floating through the air held aloft by strands of webbing suspended by electromagnetic fields. Electrified mandibles grant these spiders precise control over nearby electromagnetic fields and a potent weapon for shocking its prey.   Beneath their hunting grounds, the corpses and bones of their prey lie sparsely coated with stray strands of blue webbing. These remains wobble and glide across the ground of their own accord, caught in stray eddies in the electromagnetic field. The webbing of a balloon spider is prized by arcanists as a component for spells and the construction of magical flying machines.</description>

  <description>This creature resembles a large horned goat covered in thick green moss. A vine trails from the beast’s udder to a nearby tree. The creature smells of fresh bread and floral grapes._   **Born of Fruit.** The barometz is a strange plant-like monster that arises spontaneously from a normal fruit tree, some say as the result of ancient druidic magic or fey meddling. A fruit tree bearing a barometz grows an unusually large fruit that soon drops from the tree and bursts open to reveal the goat-like creature. The barometz remains attached to its parent plant by a vine and spends its life clearing the area around the fruit tree of weeds and other noxious plants.   **A Feast for Kings.** The flesh of a barometz is considered a delicacy by almost all humanoids and giants, and few barometz survive for long once they are discovered by a band of trollkin hunters or foraging hill giants. Elves and other woodland humanoids have attempted to breed barometz, without success. The creature does not reproduce naturally and the methods by which they appear are still unknown.</description>

It carries an elaborate silver bell in its bony hands, and its skull gleams white in the moonlight._   **Heralds of Calamity.** The black crier is an undead that appears hours, days, or even months before a great catastrophe. The larger the catastrophe, the earlier the black crier appears.   **Servants of Fate.** Black criers are not malicious or vengeful undead and exist to warn of coming danger. They defend themselves if attacked but don’t pursue fleeing opponents.   **Mute Messengers.** Despite their name, black criers cannot speak; instead, they use cryptic hand gestures or other mysterious signs to warn people of the impending calamity.   **Undead Nature.** A black crier doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.    ## Portents of Disaster     A black crier is always accompanied by signs of impending disaster. The crier isn’t affected or targeted by these portents, but it otherwise has no control over them. The portents appear within a black crier’s bound region (see the Bound by Calamity trait) and can be one or more of the following, becoming more frequent as the date of the catastrophe approaches: * Swarms of rats or insects appear, destroying crops, eating food stores, and spreading disease. * The ground in the region experiences minor tremors, lasting 1d6 minutes. * Thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes plague the region, lasting 1d6 hours. * Natural water sources in the region turn the color of blood for 1d4 hours. The water is safe to drink, and the change in color has no adverse effect on local flora and fauna.</description>

  <description>A humanoid in blurred gray tones settles in the shadowed corner of a dimly-lit room and disappears from view._   **Poor Players.** Some people are driven to perform. They crave the adulation of their peers, the attention of strangers, the promise of fame and the immortality it brings. Unfortunately, not every such artist has the talent and perseverance to succeed. Whenever a minstrel flees a stage pelted by rotting produce and ends their life in despair, or an actor’s alcoholism leads them to an early grave after a scathing review, a bleakheart is born. Once a bleakheart rises, it seeks to spread hopelessness and create new bleakhearts.   **Walking Shadows.** Bleakhearts exist on the fringes of the societies where they once lived. When they are not skulking in the dark, the citizenry ignores them as they would any other drifter. They linger around taverns, theaters, and other places the living visit for entertainment. Sometimes the sight and sound of merriment rouses the bleakhearts from cold despair to hot rage. The resulting carnage invariably leads to the destruction of the originating bleakheart and the creation of several new ones.   **Familiar Faces.** A bleakheart gains grim satisfaction in causing distress to the living, especially those who have recently experienced joy. By day, they lurk in deeply shadowed areas of settlements, usually around places of entertainment, and skim the thoughts of passersby. When a bleakheart detects someone who is elated, it follows them home for further observation. While its victim sleeps, the bleakheart probes their mind, causing the victim nightmares about the subject of their happiness. Once the victim awakens, its joy turned to pain, the bleakheart disguises itself as the personage who once brought the victim joy and reveals itself. Even while magically disguised, a bleakheart appears disquietingly out of focus.   **Undead Nature.** A bleakheart doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A humanoid statue made of green stone streaked with red steps forward, its long, curved claws reaching out. Its face is blank of features except two deep eye sockets that drip fresh blood like tears._   Evil cults exsanguinate sacrifices over specially prepared bloodstone statues, infusing the life force of the victims into the rock and granting it life. These sentinels are driven to see more blood spilled, whether by their own hands, those of their masters, or even those of their enemies.   **Blood Calls Blood.** The blood infused into the sentinel perpetually leaks out, a representation of the agony that created the construct. This agony pulls on nearby creatures, drawing out vital fluids and ripping minor wounds into great injuries. The sentinel stores this blood inside itself, and the red veins in its stone become more prevalent the more blood it stores.   **Mindless Fury.** Those who create bloodstone sentinels invariably see power through the spilling of blood and utilize the construct to spread their faith. Some blood cults use the sentinels as mobile containers for the primary component of their profane rituals.   **Construct Nature.** A bloodstone sentinel doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bonespitter, and it takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the bonespitter’s turns. An undead creature made of mostly bones, such as a skeleton, is immune to this acid damage. If the bonespitter takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the bonespitter must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the bonespitter. If the bonespitter dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

  <description>A massive worm bursts through the ground, its body covered in bony protrusions._   Bonespitters are bone-covered predators that live in the soft soil of grassy plains.   **Bones of Victims.** Bonespitters have unique digestive systems. When a bonespitter consumes another creature, the acid in the worm’s stomach dissolves all of the prey’s tissue and leaves only bones behind. The bones become part of the bonespitter’s defenses, poking through its skin like sharp hair follicles. Other bones are stored in muscular sacks in the bonespitter’s mouth, waiting to be unleashed on unsuspecting prey.</description>

  <description>Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._   **Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.   **Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License</description>

While bonded in this way, the brain hood’s statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, including the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice, but the brain hood retains its alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, along with its Speak with Beasts trait. In addition, the brain hood retains its ability to cast spells. The brain hood can’t be targeted specifically while bonded with a creature. It can detach itself from the creature and end the bond by spending 5 feet of its movement.

  <description>A bear with the top of its head covered in a strange, slick, black substance looks around with purpose._   **Parasitic.** Brain hoods are parasites that are rarely encountered without host animals. In fact, outside of its host, a brain hood poses little danger to intelligent creatures or creatures who are not beasts. Brain hoods prefer to bond with larger creatures, such as bears or dire wolves, due to the beasts’ impressive physical prowess. They use the animals as powerful physical vessels, helping the host creature find food but otherwise subjugating the dim intelligence within it.   **Calculating.** The brain hood is inherently evil and despises all living things that possess bodies of their own. They delight in using their beast forms to attack and kill humanoids, particularly if the humanoids are smaller or less powerful than their bonded beast.   **Druidic Enemies.** Given the unique nature of a brain hood’s existence, some people mistake them for druids in beast form. Brain hoods often encourage this belief, sowing mistrust and discord between villagers and a local circle of druids. This practice, coupled with the brain hood’s abominable treatment of beasts, drives druids to hunt down and destroy brain hoods. Traveling druids listen for stories of sudden, uncommonly aggressive animal attacks, knowing the cause could be a sign that a brain hood is in the area.</description>

  <description>This creature is a disturbing combination of wolf and locust, and the smoke it exhales hovers thickly around it. Fur surrounds its locust head, and long, insectoid legs extend from its canine body._   **Unnatural Origin.** Brimstone locusthounds are the result of magical experimentation. Scholars are uncertain if the experiment went terribly wrong or if the creatures turned out as originally intended. The wizards who created them have been dead for thousands of years, allowing theories—and the wizards’ creations—to run wild ever since.   **Migrating Packs.** Brimstone locusthounds build their nests below ground, in caves, or in buried ruins. They are migratory omnivores, and they prefer areas where fungi and small prey are plentiful. Though less caring for each other than most canines, brimstone locusthounds often form packs to rear young and when food is plentiful. However, when food becomes scarce, a pack of locusthounds tears itself apart, cannibalizing its weakest members, and the survivors scatter to the wind.</description>

  <description>An enormous deep purple flower pushes forward on its vines, which are covered in throbbing black protrusions. As it moves, a single protrusion bursts open, spraying a green, sizzling substance all over the forest floor._   **Meat Drinkers.** Bulbous violets are carnivorous plants. The black growths that cover their vines are filled with acid and pop on impact, dissolving the violets’ prey. The plants then stand in the remains and drink in the liquefied gore.   **Migrating Predators.** Bulbous violets travel in packs that follow warm weather. Although they can survive the cold, most of their prey disappears in the colder months, forcing the plants to travel for food. Sometimes these paths take the plants through farms where the plants attack livestock and people. If the violets find food, they stop their migration, hunting every morsel they can find before moving on. Violets can sense the nearby presence of creatures made of flesh. This magical ability guides their migration route and leads them into unexpected places.   **Germinating in Gore.** In order to grow, bulbous violet seeds need to be sown in ground that has been covered in the blood, entrails, and corpses of other creatures. When a pack of violets is ready to drop their seeds, they go into areas crowded with prey and begin killing all they can. They attack monster hideouts, animal herds, and even villages to provide enough sustenance for their seeds.</description>

It occasionally rises from the deep underwater caves in which it lives to slaughter and devour any creature that comes within its reach. The butatsch’s amorphous body is easily as big as an elephant, and its countless eyes are frightening to behold. The butatsch burns or melts organic material before absorbing it and leaves nothing behind when it has finished eating.   **Unsettling Morality.** While the butatsch leaves a path of destruction wherever it goes, it is driven by a bizarre morality. It has been known to ignore and even protect weak or defenseless targets, such as farmers and cowherds, against other monsters and humanoids, slaughtering the weaker creatures’ persecutors before vanishing back into the lake from which it came.</description>

  <description>The skeleton of a humanoid stands bent over with one arm holding the vacuous space where its stomach would be. Its jaw hangs agape, cackling, as it points at the target of its humor._   **Ironic Origins.** When a creature who utterly fears death perishes in an area filled with necrotic energy, it arises as a cackling skeleton. The creature’s dead bones animate to mock the futility of their once-cherished desire of life. The cackling skeleton often wears garish items that parody what it loved in life.   **Nihilistic Hecklers.** Cackling skeletons find living creatures’ survival instincts humorous. They find living incredibly futile and believe those that prolong their existence to be hilariously foolish. Unlike other skeletons, cackling skeletons are capable of speech, and they use it to point out the silliness of healing, wearing armor, or other means of self preservation, often pointing out the creature will inevitably die anyway.   **Undead Nature.** The cackling skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The ground seems to crawl with tiny skeletal humanoids. Red pinpricks of baleful light emanate from empty eye sockets. The creatures have bony wings and tiny, vicious-looking teeth._   **Punished Fey.** Cadaver sprites are the skeletal remains of sprites that have failed the fey courts. Some of them befriended non-fey and left the forest, others were simply too lazy to complete their duties, and many more were punished for dozens of other reasons. Whatever the case, the fey lords and ladies corrupt the bodies of the sprites so they can accomplish in death what they failed to do in life. As part of this corruption, the sprites’ wings are reduced to bones, which removes their freedom to fly and forces them to stick to bushes and foliage. They typically band together and assault their opponents in large groups.   **Retain Elements of Individuality.** Unlike many forms of simple undead, cadaver sprites retain memories of their lives. These memories serve as a constant reminder of their failures. Those who associated with them in life consider them cursed or no longer recognize them. This inability to connect with those they once knew, combined with the compulsion to protect the forest and continue their previous duties, drives many cadaver sprites to madness.   **Deathspeakers.** For reasons known only to the sprites and the fey lords and ladies that created them, cadaver sprites are often found in areas occupied by Open Game License</description>

  <description>What was a mere patch of green grass suddenly uproots itself and shows its true form: a flat, turtle-like creature with a wide maw filled with sharklike wooden teeth._   **Grassland Ambushers.** The carnivorous sod is a plant monster that disguises itself as a simple patch of grass until it is stepped on. It then uses its grass-like tendrils to trip a creature before biting with its vicious jaws. Carnivorous sods typically prey on small herbivores, such as deer and rabbits, that come to graze on their backs, but they have been known to attack just about anything that treads on them as long as the target is Medium or smaller. Sometimes dozens of carnivorous sods gather together to hunt, though this is due more to happenstance than planning on the part of the monsters.   **Links to the Fey.** Carnivorous sods begin their lives when a fey creature such as a pixie or Open Game License</description>

No one is quite sure of its source, but wherever domestic cats are found, these creatures appear. It is a hybrid monster, created when an aberrant virus infects a cat or cat-like humanoid.   **Summoned by Rage.** An infected cat doesn’t transform until it becomes angry, leaving many communities unaware of the disease until it is too late. Once a cat is sufficiently upset, it swells to a massive size, turning into a catscratch intent on destroying everything in sight.</description>

  <description>Widely-spaced, large eyes sit on either side of the dragon’s broad, flat head, and sharp, curving teeth fill its fearsome maw. It clings to the ceiling, silently waiting for prey to appear below._   Highly adapted to hunting underground, this lesser cousin of true dragons stalks cavern passages for prey.   **Patient Predator.** An adult cave drake is between ten and fifteen feet long, with a thin, whip-like tail that nearly doubles its overall length. Its scales are dull and colored to match the surrounding stone. A cave drake hunts by lying in wait for prey to pass, often hanging from a wall or ceiling, before ambushing with its blinding venom. The drake then tracks the blinded creature as it flees, using a keen sense of smell and the creature’s disorientation to follow it. A cave drake will follow prey patiently for miles, unless its quarry wanders into the territory of another cave drake.   **Solitary Hunter.** The cave drake is a lone predator. It typically lairs in high-roofed caverns, atop sheer ledges, or in other areas where it can take advantage of its superior climbing ability. Each cave drake claims a wide expanse of tunnels and caverns as its territory. A cave drake will fight to defend its territory from all other creatures, including other cave drakes, with the exception of mating season, when territories fluctuate as female drakes search for mates. A female cave drake will lay two to five eggs, raising the young until they are able to hunt on their own, then driving them out.   **Hoards.** Like their true dragon kin, cave drakes collect treasure, favoring shiny metals and sparkling gemstones. They will often arrange such treasures near phosphorescent fungi, glowing crystals, or other sources of light. Unlike true dragons, cave drakes are not overly protective or jealous of their hoards. The more cunning of their kind often use such objects as bait to draw out greedy prey while they wait in ambush.</description>

Rather than retain the bodily form it possessed in life, the creature’s skin sloughs off from parts of its body as aquatic features burst through its flesh. Its fingers and toes become webbed, and fins form on its back and down its legs.   **Decay.** The cavefish zombie’s dead tissue holds water, causing it to look bloated and loose and afflicting it with a persistent rot. This rot results in a horrific odor, which follows them whether they are in water or on land.   **Undead Nature.** A cavefish zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

A massive body accompanies the heads, revealing they all belong to one creature. The creature’s odd feet and long, curled tail transport it from tree to tree with ease, and its sticky tongues allow it to slurp up prey on the forest floor as it passes._   The chameleon hydra thrives in thick, wooded areas where it makes nests in the canopies of large trees. It feasts on prey both above and below the canopy, using its sticky tongues to snatch unsuspecting prey.   **Apex Ambush Predators.** Chameleon hydras have scales that react to light and allow the hydras to blend in with their surroundings. They are extremely patient, waiting until the most opportune time to strike from a safe vantage point. Chameleon hydras primarily eat birds and giant insects, but they are known to dine on unwary travelers if other prey is scarce.   **Curious and Colorful.** Study of juvenile chameleon hydras shows they have inquisitive minds and that they alternate their scales in colorful patterns when near others of their kind. Scholars believe they use these color changes as a rudimentary form of communication.</description>

  <description>This large sheepdog has luxuriant white-gold fur. A pair of broad wings stretches out from the creature’s back, and its eyes are filled with an intelligent, silvery gleam._   **Celestial Guard Dogs.** Created from the souls of exceptionally faithful guards and retainers who selflessly sacrificed themselves to protect others, chamrosh are celestials that take the form of large sheepdogs with silver-gold fur and eagle-like wings. They are known for their ability to sniff out evil and for their steadfast nature, refusing to back down from a fight even in the face of overwhelming odds. Because of this quality, chamrosh are often used as guard beasts by other celestials, though they are never treated as simple pets by even the haughtiest of angels.   **Roaming Defenders.** When not employed by more powerful celestials as companions and guards, chamrosh gather in small packs to roam the planes of good, attacking any fiend or evil monster they come across. They also rescue lost or trapped mortals of good or neutral alignment, leading the mortals to a place of safety or to the nearest portal back to the Material Plane. Despite their appearance, chamrosh can speak and readily do so with mortals they rescue or celestials they serve or protect. .   **Occasional Planar Travelers.** Chamrosh rarely travel to the Material Plane, but when they do, it is usually for an important mission, such as to defend a holy relic or to aid a paladin on a divine quest. Since a chamrosh cannot change its form, such missions do not generally involve infiltration or deception, and when the task is finished, the chamrosh is quick to return to its normal duties.</description>

    <text>The chatterlome magically teleports up to 120 feet into a box, chest, wardrobe, or other wooden container with a lid or door. The chatterlome can hide inside the container as a bonus action after teleporting. If the chatterlome uses this action while inside a container, it can teleport into another container within range or it can teleport back to the Hells. If it teleports to the Hells, it can’t return to the Material Plane until it is summoned.</text>

  <description>When the oaken box is found on your stoop, run—for the box devil is soon to come._   Chatterlomes have featureless grey heads with large, round eyes, and their circular mouths are filled with needlelike teeth. They have misshapen torsos and short, bandy legs. Their most notable feature, though, is their four arms, which always wield woodworking tools.   **Vengeance Seekers.** Chatterlomes prey on scorned lovers, offering violent revenge for those who have been wronged. When a person calls upon the chatterlome, they soon receive an intricately carved oaken box with an obsidian inlay of a humanoid heart. Upon touching the box, the supplicant immediately knows that the box must be delivered to the home of the person who wronged the supplicant. When the victim opens the box, the chatterlome springs forth, claiming the heart of the victim and fulfilling the supplicant’s request. Whether or not the box is opened, a chatterlome whose box has been delivered knows the location of the victim and tracks the person relentlessly. After the victim dies, the supplicant must then deliver the chatterlome’s box to nine more victims or forfeit their own life. A string of deaths occurring shortly after victims received mysterious boxes is a sure sign that a chatterlome is in the area.   **Box Devils.** Chatterlomes are often called “box devils” due to their peculiar ability to magically travel between boxes and other enclosed, wooden objects. Though chatterlomes can travel between boxes, each chatterlome has its original box, created when it was summoned by a supplicant who was scorned. If the chatterlome’s original box is destroyed, the chatterlome returns to the Hells, where it waits for another scorned lover to call it back to the Material Plane.</description>

  <description>This ghostly humanoid’s hands end in frozen claws. Water drips from the claws, freezing before it hits the ground._   **Forlorn Spirits.** Chill haunts arise from the corpses of humanoids that froze to death. While most chill haunts derive from those who died alone in the cold, stories tell of entire families or villages returning as chill haunts. Because of the intensity of their demise, chill haunts dread cold and flee when targeted by cold magic.   **Hungry for Body Heat.** The chill haunt’s disdain for cold leads it to seek out warm buildings or open fires. While ambient heat or direct contact with fire diminishes its shivering and restores wounds it has received in combat, it craves heat from living creatures. Contact with the chill haunt sets off a deepening freeze in the victim, which is hard to reverse without the application of fire. The haunt comes into contact with living creatures to remember the feeling of warmth, and it does not care about the side effects of its touch. After it has drained the warmth from one creature, it immediately moves on to the next, ever-hungry.   **Restless Undead.** Destroying a chill haunt is only a temporary solution to the undead creature’s depredations. Similar to a ghost, a destroyed chill haunt returns to unlife 24 hours after its demise, attaining eternal rest only after being slain under a specific set of circumstances. For most chill haunts, the surest way to eternal rest is by coaxing the haunt to a warm building where it can sit by a hearth and nestle in blankets or furs. Though physical objects normally pass through the spectral creature, such conditions allow the coverings to conform to the shape of the haunt’s former body. Moments later, the haunt lets out a contented sigh and winks out of existence.   **Undead Nature.** A chill haunt doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

They stand as bulwarks upon the battlefields of the holy, offering a rallying point for paladins and crusaders. Churches that have the ability to manufacture clockwork archons guard the knowledge jealously, lest it fall into the hands of the unworthy.   **Engines of War.** Clockwork archons are deployed as support vehicles and weapons. A single archon can quickly reduce a small settlement’s defenses to ruin, while groups of them can swiftly render fortified structures to rubble. Armies with clockwork archons at their disposal sometimes use them to move sensitive material and personnel into position.   **Corruptible Constructs.** On occasion, a clockwork archon is captured by the enemy. The followers of some evil gods, archdevils, and demon lords have determined methods of overwriting the construct’s animating magic, turning the creature to their fell purposes. More than one community has had its cheer turn to dismay as the clockwork archon they freely allowed inside the walls disgorged enemy agents while attacking the structures and residents. More insidious cults use their clockwork archons to mask their true natures. They allow the common folk to believe they represent good faiths while they rot the community’s moral fabric from the inside.   **Construct Nature.** A clockwork archon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>From a distance this creature appears to be an enormous leech. Closer observation reveals it to be a clockwork device. Blood stains its maw, which leaks a green fluid with a vaguely astringent odor._   **Collectors of Blood.** Hags and other magic practitioners who require blood for their rituals and sacrifices create clockwork leeches to scout marshlands and neighboring settlements for large groups of living creatures. The leeches are designed to extract their fill and return to their controllers, who access and drain their reservoirs. Autonomous clockwork leeches continue to collect blood, but, without masters to whom they deliver it, they go through cycles of draining blood then violently disgorging it. Regardless of their purpose (or lack thereof) for obtaining blood, most clockwork leeches retreat after getting their fill.   **Waterproof Swimmer.** A clockwork leech has layered copper plating that keeps water away from its inner mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the leech to propel itself through water. They can use this propelling undulation on land to make attacks with their “tails.” Leeches that don’t receive regular cleanings eventually turn green as the copper corrodes.   **Unseen, Unheard, and Unfelt.** The same plating that protects the clockwork leech’s inner mechanisms also buffers noise from the gears. Its coloration allows it to blend in with marshland foliage and silty water. Finally, when it punctures a creature’s skin, it releases a sedative to numb the wound, leaving the victim unaware of the injury and subsequent blood drain. The leech doesn’t have an unlimited supply of the sedative, and a leech that hasn’t undergone maintenance for a few weeks loses its Anesthetizing Bite trait. Because the leech must remain attached to its victim to drain its blood, it prefers to attack lone or sleeping targets.   **Construct Nature.** A clockwork leech doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>This large clockwork mantis is surprisingly nimble and fast, capable of taking down foes with a lethal flurry of serrated claws and bites._   **Wanted by Gnomes.** The existence of these wandering clockwork monsters creates a bad reputation for peaceful gnomish engineers. A few groups of gnomes specialize in tracking and destroying these clockwork creations. They claim to do it out of virtue, but rumors abound that they do it for rare parts.   **Construct Nature.** The clockwork mantis doesn’t require air, food, drink or sleep.</description>

  <description>The ticking of metal gears is all that hints at the presence of a pair of feline-shaped metal creatures. They are bronze and steel, with sharp metal teeth and razor claws._   **Magical Origin.** Clockwork tigers were invented as guardians in times now long forgotten. In spite of their age, they continue to serve their original purpose as guardians, protecting ancient ruins and new masters alike. The number of clockwork tigers in existence is slowly rising, leading many scholars to speculate on the reason. Some suspect the instructions for creating them were finally found, while others surmise a natural phenomenon unearthed a lost vault of clockwork tigers.   **Found in Pairs.** Clockwork tigers are almost always found in pairs and almost always guarding a spellcaster or magical object, which they consider their “ward.” The tigers work in tandem to defeat threats and protect their wards, leaping in and out of combat. Their clockwork brains are capable of thought, but they are less interested in communication and wholly devoted to protecting their wards.   **Construct Nature.** A clockwork tiger doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Once the ritual is complete, the creature appears in the branches of a nearby tree. It then stalks the village and its surroundings. A colláis returns to its home plane after 24 hours.</description>

  <description>The torso of a pale humanoid woman melds into the thorax of a massive insect. It moves about on six pointed legs, stabbing through stone and metal alike._   **Born in Chaos.** The first conjoined queen was created when cultists sacrificed a captured queen to their dark insectoid god. In a ritual of chaotic magic, the human queen and an insect queen were joined, forming a chitinous chrysalis from which the conjoined queen eventually emerged.   **Rulers of the Many-Legged.** A conjoined queen rules from a subterranean throne room, often in a burrow under the ruins of a fallen monarchy’s castle. There she commands her insectoid host and sits atop a pile of incubating eggs.   **Hungry for Power.** The conjoined queen hungers for humanoid flesh but also for power. She seeks to rule and conquer humanoids and insects alike. Her armies consist of giant insects and the humanoids who ride them into battle.</description>

  <description>A large, bloated worm, its body the gray-white pallor of death and slicked with yellow mucus, crawls across a pile of corpses. As its dozens of legs propel it over the bodies, its fang-filled maw opens to reveal a second jaw that repeatedly bursts outward, slurping up chunks of flesh with each strike._   These creatures prowl deep caverns, seeking flesh to devour.   **Eaters of the Dead.** The corpse worm feeds primarily on death and decay, though it hunts and kills living prey it encounters if hungry. Corpse worms have a keen sense of smell that they can use to locate wounded prey or sources of carrion on which to feed.   **Ignore the Unliving.** While both the living and the dead are food for the corpse worm, it doesn’t feed upon the undead. Unless attacked, the corpse worm ignores undead near it. Some intelligent undead tame and train corpse worms, using them as pets, guardians, or shock troops.   **Slimy Eggs.** A female corpse worm lays up to two dozen eggs in crevasses, cul-de-sacs, or other remote areas. Corpse worm eggs are about the size of a human head and are sheathed in a rubbery, translucent gray membrane. The eggs are deposited with a sticky, mustard-colored excretion, allowing them to be placed on walls or even ceilings. This excretion exudes a powerful smell that many subterranean predators find unpleasant, and it allows the mother to relocate the eggs as she watches over them until they hatch.</description>

  <description>A wrinkly, purple-skinned pixie with small black horns and bat wings flits about, chanting a violent song about harvesting organs._   Corrupted pixies are fey turned fiends who savor violence.   **Corrupted by Hags.** Hags sometimes capture pixies and torture them by forcing the tiny fey beings to watch the hags commit acts of depraved violence. These acts combined with the hags’ magic drive the pixies mad, twisting their forms and turning them into corrupt versions of what they once were. The corrupted pixies become fiends that live to serve the hags who created them. Many of these pixies think of their creators as gods who exposed the world’s true joys: murder, torture, and other evil acts.   **Mischief Makers.** Hags send corrupted pixies to cause mischief and chaos to punish their enemies, for their own entertainment, or as a distraction from the hags’ more sinister schemes. The pixies delight in these tasks, often using their magic to make people harm one another and remaining invisible as long as they can. Corrupted pixies like to make the pain last as long as possible before their tricks satisfyingly result in another creature’s death.   **Destroy Beauty.** Corrupted pixies take a special joy in destroying anything beautiful, be it a work of art, a garden, or the face of a handsome adventurer. The fiends sometimes become distracted from their hag-assigned tasks because the opportunity to mar something perfect is too good to pass up.   **Restored by Pixie Dust.** If a corrupted pixie is captured, it can be restored to its fey form. The captured pixie must be showered with pixie dust every day at sunrise for ten consecutive days. On the final day, the pixie reverts to its original form.</description>

The diseased creature’s lungs fill with the spores, which kill the creature in a number of days equal to 1d10 + the creature’s Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. One hour after infection, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it rises as a crimson shambler, roaming for 1 week and attempting to infect any other creatures it encounters. At the end of the week, it collapses, its body fertilizing a new patch of crimson slime.

  <description>The bloody corpse stands up, dripping a red slime. As each drop hits the ground, it splatters into little red spores._   The crimson shambler is an intermediary form of a hazardous slime mold found in deep caverns. It wanders the dark passageways, attacking any creatures it encounters to infect them with its spores.   **Gruesome Appearance.** The crimson shambler is a mobile plant, feeding off the remains of an infected creature. The overlay of red slime atop an ambulatory decomposing corpse is often mistaken as some type of undead creature. In actuality, the remains are animated by a slime mold, allowing it to hunt and infect other creatures until it finds a suitable place to spawn. Then it falls and becomes a new colony of crimson slime.</description>

    <text>The crinaea can sense water within 300 feet of it that was drawn from its bonded source within the last 24 hours. As a bonus action, the crinaea can poison up to 1 gallon of water within 300 feet of it that was drawn from its bonded source. This can even affect water that has been used to make another nonmagical substance, such as soup or tea, or water that was consumed within the last 30 minutes. The poison can affect a target through contact or ingestion. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.</text>

    <name>Water-bound Form</name>
    <text>The crinaea is bound to its water source. If the crinaea is separated from its water source for more than 24 hours, the crinaea gains 1 level of exhaustion. It gains an additional level of exhaustion for each day until it bonds with another water source or it dies. The crinaea can bond with a new water source and remove its levels of exhaustion by finishing a long rest while submerged in the new water source.</text>

  <description>A beautiful figure made of water and plants steps from the lake and smiles._   Crinaea are nymph-like water fey that inhabit small bodies of water such as wells and fountains.   **Water-bound Fey.** Similar to dryads, crinaea are bound to a body of water which becomes their home and focal point. Unlike dryads, crinaea can choose to be bound to a water source and can change which water source they call home. A crinaea must submerge itself in its bound water source every day or suffer. As long as the water source stays pure and the crinaea never travels more than a mile from it, the crinaea can live indefinitely. If its home water source is ever dried up or destroyed, the crinaea quickly fades until it finds a new home or dies.   **Friendly but Poisonous.** One of the most gregarious fey, the crinaea enjoys long conversations with intelligent creatures. The crinaea is often well-versed in the goings-on around its home and happily shares such information with friendly creatures. It offers its pure water to those in need and those who are polite, but woe be unto those who anger the fey after having tasted its water, as the crinaea can poison any water taken from its home.</description>

  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Paralyzing Gaze</name>
    <text>When a creature that can see the crocotta’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the crocotta, the crocotta can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the crocotta isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed until the start of its next turn.

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the crocotta until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the crocotta in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Canines are immune to the crocotta’s Paralyzing Gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have advantage on the saving throw.</text>

  <description>A human voice emanates from a lion-like hyena. As it speaks, its black tongue runs over the many teeth in its unnaturally wide mouth._   **Disturbing Grin.** The crocotta’s mouth stretches back to its ears, allowing its powerful jaw to open unnaturally wide. In spite of its large mouth, the crocotta is able to perfectly mimic the sounds of humanoid voices. When hunting, it often mimics the sounds of a person in need, luring in a victim, then pounces on the victim when they investigate the sounds.   **Dog Hater.** The crocotta holds particular animosity toward dogs and attacks them before more obvious threats. Dogs innately understand this about crocotta and often purposefully distract an attacking crocotta to allow their humanoid families to escape.   **Oracular Eyes.** The gemstone eyes of the crocotta hold its prey captive when the crocotta is alive, but they grant visions of the future after its death. If a crocotta’s eye is placed under a creature’s tongue within five days of the crocotta’s death, the creature experiences omens of the future similar to those produced by the augury spell.</description>

  <description>This enormous, squat beast has a shaggy hide of ice. Two translucent horns protrude from its snout, the frontmost of which looks like a scimitar._   **Elemental-Touched Rhino.** A cryoceros resembles a woolly rhinoceros made of ice. Its thick, frozen hide protects the soft flesh at its core, and a layer of ice forms over its already formidable, keratinous horns. The creature’s body is efficient at transferring warmth to its fleshy interior; fire still harms a cryoceros, but its icy form is not unduly damaged by fiery attacks. A cryoceros has a second stomach that stores ice it consumes. As a defense mechanism, the cryoceros can spew stinging, pulverized ice from this alternate stomach.   **Slow Metabolisms.** Cryoceroses survive on stunted grasses and other plants that thrive in the tundra, as well as ice and snow, to replenish their icy exteriors. Despite their size, they don’t require a great deal of sustenance, and they conserve their energy by slowly grazing across frozen plains. Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them.   **Cantankerous Mounts.** Gentleness and a regular source of food temporarily earns the cryoceroses’ trust, and patient humanoids can manage to train the creatures to accept riders. This works for convenience much more than for combat, since cryoceroses balk at fighting with loads on their backs. A cryoceros in combat with a rider either stands stock still until its rider dismounts or, worse, rolls over to throw its rider, often crushing the rider in the process. Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts.</description>

  <description>The cavern glitters with refracted light bouncing off thousands of crystals. A towering menhir of shimmering crystal dominates the center of the cavern._   Whether a rare evolution of silicate life or a wandering nomadic race from some alternate reality, crystalline monoliths are enigmatic beings found deep underground in caverns where giant crystals flourish and grow.   **Crystal Gardens.** Crystalline monoliths reside in areas of living crystal, these formations often growing to gigantic proportions, resembling the monolith itself. Some sages speculate that crystalline monoliths grow crystals to certain specifications, then use their magic to instill sentience in the crystals as a means of reproducing. Whether the gardens are for reproduction or some other mysterious purpose, the crystal monoliths are very protective of them. The environment of these gardens is often not comfortable for most humanoid life; the temperature may be extremely hot or cold, or the cavern may contain poisonous gases or even be partially-submerged in water.   **Magical Philosophers.** Crystalline monoliths prefer to spend their days in quiet contemplation. They tend their crystal gardens and meditate. If encountered by other intelligent creatures, they are generally open to exchanges of information and intellectual discussion. They prefer to communicate telepathically but can create sounds through vibrations that mimic speech. Aggressive intruders are dealt with according to the level of threat they exhibit. If the crystalline monolith considers the intruders unlikely to cause it harm, it will often use its magic to misdirect opponents or lure them away from the garden. Should the intruders persist or show themselves to be dangerous, a crystalline monolith is not above using its magic to crush and destroy them. It is especially unforgiving to those that try to steal or damage crystals in its lair.   **Crystalline Nature.** A crystalline monolith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.    ## A Crystalline Monolith’s Lair     Crystalline monoliths lair in vast gardens of crystal in mountains or deep underground, often near areas of extreme temperature or geothermal activity. They harness the ambient magical energy in the crystals to defend themselves and repel intruders.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crystalline monolith takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the crystalline monolith can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The crystalline monolith creates an illusory duplicate of itself in its space. The double moves or speaks according to the monolith’s mental direction. Each time a creature targets the monolith with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack hits and destroys the duplicate. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which monolith is real. On a success, the creature identifies the illusion. The duplicate is intangible, but otherwise is identical to the monolith by sight, smell, or hearing. The duplicate lasts for 1 minute or until the monolith uses this lair action again. * The crystalline monolith vibrates at a frequency that reverberates through the lair, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature on the ground within 60 feet of the monolith (except for the crystalline monolith itself) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. * Magically-charged shards of crystal fire from the crystals in the lair, striking up to two targets within 60 feet of the crystalline monolith. The crystalline monolith makes one ranged attack roll (+3 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) psychic damage.</description>

  <description>A slender, humanoid-shaped plant dances in a clearing. Its two long legs and four arms are decorated with a plethora of vibrant petals and serrated leaves. A wide flower blossoms at the top of the whimsical performer._   **Jovial Creations.** Dancing foliage appears in areas where the magic of the arts combines with the magic of nature. Birthed by such magic, the creature is influenced by both: it loves the arts and is protective of the natural world.   **Garden Guardians.** Dancing foliage primarily inhabits and defends forest groves from outside threats, but they sometimes wander the gardens of urban settlements. Their love of flowers causes them to tend and protect the plants at all costs, often to the dismay of the garden’s owner or castle groundskeeper. Once a dancing foliage has decided to protect an area, it refuses to leave, though terms of pruning and planting can be negotiated with it, especially if such actions make the garden more aesthetically pleasing.   **Dancing Gardeners.** When tending to its garden, dancing foliage moves to some unheard tune, gracefully leaping, twirling, and bobbing around the garden. If it or its garden is threatened, the dancing foliage enters a battle dance until the threat is either removed or eliminated. It never pursues foes beyond the end of its garden.</description>

  <description>The eyes and ears of undead armies, darakhul spies originate from all nations and backgrounds.   **Masters of Disguise.** Darakhul spies are rarely without a slew of disguises, including wigs, colored pastes, cosmetics, and clothing appropriate for various nationalities and economic levels. Some of the best spies have spent decades hiding in plain sight in courts, taverns, and slums across the world.   **Complex Network.** Each spy has one superior to whom it reports, and each superior spy has a separate superior spy to whom it reports. Only the highest leaders have knowledge of the intricacies of the spy network, and even they aren’t fully aware of the true identities of their furthest-reaching agents.   _**Hungry Dead Nature.**_ The darakhul doesn’t require air or sleep.</description>

  <description>A filthy burial shroud glides silently through the air, the vague features of a humanoid outlined on its cotton surface. The stench of an open grave hangs around it._   **Suffocating Automatons.** A death shroud golem is created from the used burial shroud of a humanoid. Most death shroud golems are stained with dirt, blood, or mold, and a few are covered in even more unsavory substances. Despite their appearance, death shroud golems are sturdy constructs and can take quite a beating. A death shroud golem typically strikes from a hidden location, grappling and suffocating its victim.   **Funerary Constructs.** Death shroud golems are normally found guarding tombs or other locations where their appearance wouldn’t arouse suspicion. Occasionally, necromancers and intelligent undead wear death shroud golems like a cloak or robe, releasing the creature to attack their enemies.   **Construct Nature.** A death shroud golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The putrid stench of death wafts off a grotesquely muscled vulture with glowing green eyes. It opens its mouth in a shrill call, rotting meat dripping from its beak._   Death vultures are giant birds transformed by their diet of undead flesh.   **Mutated Monstrosities.** When a giant vulture gorges on undead flesh, the necromantic magic suffused in the meal warps and changes the bird’s body. The vulture’s muscles bulge in odd places, making it stronger and tougher, its eyes burn with green fire, and it reeks of rot, earning these mutated monsters the name “death vultures.” The vulture also gains the ability to regurgitate necromantic energy, which can cause the flesh of living creatures to decay and age rapidly.   **Massive Meat Appetites.** Death vultures have incredible appetites and are far more willing to attack live prey than other vultures. They have a special taste for rotting flesh, and they use their decaying breath weapon to “season” their foes with necrotic energy before using their talons and beaks to tear apart their quarry.   **Necromancer Neighbors.** Death vultures often form kettles near the lairs of necromancers as they feed on their undead creations. While some necromancers find the birds to be a nuisance, many necromancers feed the vultures, encouraging them to stay. Most death vultures are willing to trade service as guardians of the lairs for food.</description>

  <description>An ancient man in a tattered cloak with matted hair, cloudy eyes, and a deathly pallor says in a raspy voice, “Come, sit, and listen.”_   **Doomsayer.** The deathspeaker appears to be alive, if only barely, but it is an undead menace that attempts to engage people in conversation, eventually cursing the one who listens to it by predicting the listener’s death. The deathspeaker claims to be a seer who is granted glimpses into the future, saying it is there to advise people of the perils they face. Deathspeakers know their appearance can often be unsettling to humanoids, and many use disguises or heavy clothing to obscure their features.   **Evil Origins.** Deathspeakers are imparted unlife from gods of trickery and deception. Chosen from people who were charlatans in life, deathspeakers rely on their former tricks to curse the living in the names of their gods.   **Cadaver Sprites.** For reasons that aren’t understood, Open Game License</description>

  <description>This large, lanky creature has limp, slate-colored hair, a long nose, and dark green, rubbery skin. Its legs are disproportionally larger than its upper body, and its limbs are oddly curved._   Deep trolls live far underground in the lightless regions seldom tread by people. An offshoot from their cousins on the surface, they have adapted to their environment in some unusual ways. Although they have eyes that can see light normally, their primary means of navigating the darkness is through vibration sense, which they register on their rubbery, sensitive skin.   **Malleable.** After these trolls moved underground, their bodies adapted to surviving in the smaller, often cramped caverns. Their bones became soft and malleable, allowing them to access areas deep beneath the surface world. Deep trolls can elongate their limbs and body or squeeze themselves ooze-like through tiny cracks and openings until they emerge into a place large enough to accommodate their natural size.   **Tribal.** Deep trolls live in small tribes of seven to fifteen members. They raid in groups, though they can be found alone when hunting or scavenging. They are intelligent enough to communicate, but they are voracious and can rarely be reasoned with when food is present. They prefer to attack anything potentially edible that isn’t part of the tribe and deal with the repercussions later. In rare cases, when confronted with opponents who are clearly more powerful, they can be persuaded to reason and discuss terms. Deep trolls are likely to agree to mutually beneficial terms, such as helping them deal with a common enemy or providing them with something they value.</description>

  <description>This blue-skinned creature wears leather armor smeared with blood and filth, though the dagger it wields is immaculate. Its milky eyes complement equally white hair, which sprouts chaotically from its head. Its movements are twitchy and unpredictable.   _**Erratic Combatants.**_ Derro shadowseekers manifest their insanity in their physicality. They seem to have a continual series of muscle spasms that control their movements. Their apparent randomness is distracting to their foes, which enables them to better land killing blows. The bafflement they cause in combat also allows them to move about the battlefield without heed for their safety, as practiced blows fail to land on them.   _**Unreliable Allies.**_ Shadowseekers are aware they are more effective when allying with other creatures, but they detest working with others. If a situation forces shadowseekers to work with allies, they often mock their ostensible partners and work to maneuver their allies into unfavorable positions. A squabbling group of shadowseekers invokes a bewildering array of threats and ridicule that often throws off their foes.</description>

  <description>The muscled reptilian swings its mighty axe at angels and fiends alike on the front lines of a reptilian army._   The largest and strongest of the satarre, destroyers hold the shield wall and strike down their enemies throughout the planes. These hulking specimens wear banded or scaled armor, often with a glistening varnish finish. Their most common weapons include spears, heavy polearms, and axes.   **Shield Wall.** Large squads and companies of satarre destroyers often use void magic to create crackling, violet shield walls. When they do, the destroyers stand shoulder to shoulder, their shields overlapping, and prevent enemies from advancing past them to the mystics they protect.   **Necrotic Lore.** Satarre destroyers are well-versed in necromantic magic and other arcana, although they do not perform it themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command undead minions using Void Speech.</description>

    <text>As a bonus action, the dimensional shambler can see 60 feet into any of the Lower Planes when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

  <trait>
    <name>Maddening Form</name>
    <text>When a creature that can see the dimensional shambler starts its turn within 30 feet of the dimensional shambler, the dimensional shambler can force it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the dimensional shambler is not incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the dimensional shambler until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dimensional shambler in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.</text>

  <description>The large creature lumbers forward, its ape-like and insectoid features blending incomprehensibly. It blinks in and out of existence, closing in on prey in a manner that betrays both the eye and time itself._   Solitary and efficient hunters, dimensional shamblers often materialize in closed structures to surprise prey that believes it is safely hidden. Capable of seeing into and entering the Lower Planes, they regularly stalk targets in the Material Plane by hopping in and out of other planes to remain undetectable.   **Disturbing Form.** The dimensional shambler has a rudimentary face with dead eyes, thick hide, and symetrical hands. Its claw-tipped fingers bend in either direction. Moving through many dimensions, the creature’s disturbing gait suggests a lack of any conventional skeletal structure.   **Unknown Origins.** The number and lifecycle of these creatures is unknown. No records of more than one shambler appearing in the Material Plane at one time exist, and it is not clear whether they were created by some dark or inscrutable power or evolved naturally.</description>

While it has a creature swallowed, the diminution drake can’t reduce its size below Medium. If the diminution drake dies, a swallowed creature’s hit points return to the amount it had before it was swallowed, and the creature falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the drake.</text>

  <description>The diminution drake removes its stinger from its prey, watching them shrink to one-foot-tall. It then flings its spaghetti-like tongue around the pint-sized victim and engulfs it in one swift motion._   This draconic hunter can shrink or grow from a cat-sized to a person-sized drake. Diminution drakes resemble dragons with a long, tubular snouts. Their eyes have red pupils that continually contract from wide spheres to tiny dots and back again. They have subpar vision and hearing but an extraordinary sense of smell.   **Shrinking Hunter.** The diminution drake uses the shrinking properties of its toxic breath weapon and stinger to reduce the size of its prey. Once a creature has been reduced in size, the drake uses its spaghetti-like tongue to swallow its prey.   **Hunters of Sport.** Diminution drakes can live off of rodents and small animals, but they find great satisfaction in hunting, diminishing, and devouring larger prey. The gut of the drake can digest anything, and digesting a shrunken, armored adventurer is of no consequence. The drake is a cunning hunter, often hiding as a tiny creature to set up ambushes.</description>

The crafter must use the remains of five dragons, one of each color, of adult age or older. Mages looking to construct dragonflesh golems often hire adventurers to acquire the bodies they need.   **Powered by Dragon Blood.** Dragonflesh golems require frequent infusions of dragon blood to remain operational. This blood does not need to come from a true dragon; any creature with draconic blood will suffice.   **Construct Nature.** The dragonflesh golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>These glyph-covered metal spiders slowly crawl over the cracked temples of beings beyond the minds of mortals._   Dread walker excavators are spider-shaped constructs developed to protect and excavate ancient, magical ruins. Excavators are found deep underwater or in wastelands, crawling over monuments built hundreds of years ago.   **Alien Minds.** The minds of the excavators are completely mysterious, their instructions indecipherable. Excavators are able to communicate with one another, and supposedly with their masters, but the transmission path of this communication is unknown.   **Dread Eye.** The excavator’s central eye shines complicated diagrams atop the stonework of ancient ruins, imprinting alien glyphs atop those carved hundreds of years previously. Some believe the excavators contain vast knowledge of ancient magic and lost civilizations, and sages greatly desire destroyed excavators, hoping to extract this knowledge from their remains. None have yet been successful, and many have been driven mad by the attempt.   **Construct Nature.** A dread walker excavator doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>This winged female has a short torso and long, gangly legs. Her wingspan is wider than her body is tall. Despite her awkward appearance, she moves with incredible grace._   **Protectors of the Marsh.** Egret harpies look after marshland flora and fauna, often allying themselves with druids and rangers who occupy the same area.   **Uncommonly Hospitable.** While most harpies have a reputation for sadism and bloodlust, egret harpies are considerably more welcoming. They possess the same alluring song all harpies have, but they can modulate the song to allow their captivated targets safe passage toward them. They often use their songs to prevent intruders from harming their home marshes. They can end their song in a mighty crescendo, imposing their will on those charmed by the song. The harpies typically coerce intruders to repair damages wreaked upon the marsh or to merely leave and never return. If a harpy suspects the intruders are unrepentant, she stops playing nice and allows her victims to fall prey to the marsh’s hazards.   **Powerful Yet Graceful.** The wings that hold the egret harpy’s larger frame aloft also serve as weapons. A powerful buffet from the harpy’s wing can knock down weaker foes. The harpy’s gawky build belies a fluidity to her movements, allowing her to balance on one leg even while engaged in battle.</description>

  <description>A choking cackle escapes the throat of the hyena. As it steps forward, patches of fur fall off of it, revealing bone and rotting muscle._   As their name implies, emperor’s hyenas are undead hyenas that have been magically enhanced and tied to the emperor. With rotting, matted fur, missing teeth, and baleful yellow eyes, they are easily mistaken for simple undead beasts. Their appearance belies a relentless cunning.   **Gifts from the God of Death.** The method of creation of emperor’s hyenas was a gift given directly to the emperor by the god of death and has been entrusted to only a few necromancers. Emperor’s hyenas can be created only from hyenas that were anointed protectors of the god’s holy places when they were alive. Their scarcity means they are primarily used as messengers and guardians for the emperor. The emperor rarely sends them to attack enemies unless the enemy has truly angered him. The emperor is seldom seen without a pair of emperor’s hyenas by his side. When he moves publicly, every available emperor’s hyena is deployed to ensure his safety.   **Voice of the Emperor.** Emperor’s hyenas often deliver messages when the emperor needs a messenger hardier than a Open Game License</description>

  <description>A monstrous woman with claws and hooves of shining copper, the creature stalks the roads and tracks between towns, seeking to kill and devour any who stumble across her path._   **Bane of Travelers.** Distant kin to lamias, the dreadful empusae are exclusively female. They use their supernatural abilities to hunt down and devour the flesh of those traveling along deserted roads and byways between settlements. While empusae aren’t afraid of sunlight, they tend to hunt at night, returning to caves and ruins during the day to feast on those they have killed. When travelers aren’t available, empusae target shepherds and farmers, disguising themselves as goats or donkeys to get close to their targets.   **Copper Hooves.** The legs and hooves of an empusa are extremely powerful and are sheathed in magically-hardened copper, allowing her to deliver swift and powerful kicks and move at great speed. This copper can be harvested when the empusa is slain and is often used in the construction of magical boots and staffs.</description>

  <description>A rectangular slab of thick, green ooze flows slowly across the floor. Twisting metallic veins and strange lights illuminate its translucent interior, and everything it touches dissolves into a formless sludge._   **Artificial Oozes.** Though fabricators superficially resemble monsters like ochre jellies or gelatinous cubes, they are in fact a type of construct composed of millions of minute constructs connected by an intelligent hive-mind. Most fabricators were built to aid in the construction of advanced machinery or structures and normally are not aggressive. However, their programming sometimes calls for the disposal of organic life, and they do not hesitate to apply fatal force when necessary.   **Relic of Past Empires.** The first fabricators were built by a cabal of ancient mages from a forgotten empire to construct a great weapon to use against their enemies. This weapon was completed and unleashed, subsequently dooming the creators and leaving the fabricators to carry on with the tasks assigned to them. Over time, the magical bonds to their masters’ work slowly unraveled, freeing many fabricators from their responsibilities and leaving them without purpose. Today, some of these fabricators are employed by mage guilds to aid in the construction of magic items, communicating with the mages by etching words on sheets of copper.   **Construct Nature.** A fabricator doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The robed figure formed of tattered shadows and swirling darkness has a bone-white, featureless oval disk where its face should be._   **Corporeal Shadow.** Faceless wanderers are creatures made of solid darkness. They are spawned from the Void whenever the minds of a large group of sentient creatures are broken or twisted as a result of exposure to the Void or its denizens. The minds and memories of living creatures draw them to mortal realms.   **Memory Eater.** The faceless wanderers survive by stealing memories from sentient humanoids and create new faceless wanderers when they completely drain a humanoid of its memories. Curiously, faceless wanderers don’t harm young humanoids and sometimes even aid them. Scholars speculate this odd behavior is because children possess fewer memories than adults.   **Void Traveler.** The faceless wanderer doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.</description>

  <description>As the sun gently dips below the horizon, the priest undergoes a startling transformation, his benevolent form replaced by the ghastly countenance of death._   **Temple Ghosts.** When a lawful individual dies defending a place of worship such as a temple, shrine, or other holy site, it sometimes rises as a fane spirit bound to the site, protecting it even in death. Most fane spirits were formerly clerics, though druids, paladins, and even lay worshippers can become fane spirits under the right circumstances. Fane spirits are lawful and typically only attack those who discover their undead nature or who try to harm their place of worship.   **Welcoming Priests.** During daylight hours, fane spirits appear to be living creatures, carrying on the same tasks they did when they were alive. Normal methods for detecting undead creatures do not work on them, and, unless attacked or injured, they show no outward signs of their true nature. This deception extends to the fane spirit itself, as it does not have any recollection of dying or of its time in its undead form. When this deception is revealed, the fane spirit becomes enraged with suffering and lashes out at those who made it remember.   **Undead Nature.** The fane spirit doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <name>Dark Invitation</name>
    <text>One humanoid within 30 feet of the far dorocha and that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target believes it has been invited to meet with the far dorocha’s master and accompanies the far dorocha. Although the target isn’t under the far dorocha’s control, it takes the far dorocha’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the far dorocha or its companions do anything harmful to the target, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect ends if the far dorocha is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or uses its bonus action to end the effect. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the far dorocha’s Dark Invitation for the next 24 hours.

The far dorocha can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.</text>

  <description>The fey lady’s attendant stands by, waiting on her from the shadows. The lady voices her desire, and the attendant leaps into action, calling a phantasmal charger made of midnight and shadow._   **Fey Stewards.** The far dorocha manage the servants of the fey courts and, when tasked, carry out the more sinister biddings of their masters. Fey lords and ladies prize the far dorocha for their attention to detail and composed mien.   **Abductor of Mortals.** Sometimes called the “dark man” or “fear dorcha,” these malicious fey are described in grim folk tales. Parents scare their children into obedience by telling bedtime stories of villains who ride black horses in the night and steal the ill-behaved away to lands of perpetual darkness. Woe betide the children who wake up to find they are the ones alone.</description>

  <description>The tiger rises from its slumber, stretching its draconic wings. Light glints off its backswept horns as it roars its deafening challenge at intruders._   **Treasure Hoard.** Similar to other dragons, felid dragons are treasure hoarders with an eye for shiny and sparkly things. They sometimes align themselves with those who are trying to do good in the world, though their motivation is typically selfish and focused on obtaining treasure.   **Curious and Playful.** Like most cats, felid dragons are naturally curious and often put themselves in danger just to learn more about the world. They like to play with their prey, allowing it to live a little longer than necessary before knocking it down again for their own entertainment. This behavior is unavoidably instinctual and even the most austere felid dragons succumb to it.</description>

Spiders, scorpions, and beetles are the most common, but many fey revenants have lower bodies resembling dragonflies, wasps, and locusts. Fey revenants with insect bodies that can fly have a flying speed of 30 feet.</description>

The elementals are irreparably changed and exist in a state between fire and water elemental. Too fiery for one and too watery for the other, they often find their way to the Material Plane, where they can carve out their own territory.   **Geothermal Dwellers.** Fire-infused water elementals prefer to inhabit areas with water heated by geothermal activity, such as hot springs and geysers. They claim such locations as their homes and grow violent when creatures harm or pollute their claimed waters. Fire-infused water elementals get along well with Open Game License</description>

Hollowed out areas give the impression of a mouth and a pair of eyes._   **Disgusting Display.** At a distance, the fleshdreg’s appearance is not quite so disturbing, but a close-up view invokes revulsion in many creatures. Their most unsettling aspect—the constant spewing of plant material—is due to a strange regenerative factor. The trees spontaneously generate plant material, which negatively interacts with their acidic interiors and causes them near-constant digestive discomfort. The fleshdregs can direct this acidified material as a spew, which temporarily suspends this continual production, but they are hesitant to do so except in extreme circumstances. If they lose too much acid or their acid somehow becomes neutralized, the pulpy material fills their innards, bloating them and eventually erupting through their skin.   **Friendly Trees.** Many intelligent creatures encountering fleshdregs judge them by their horrifying features, but the fleshdregs are amiable hosts. They understand that many creatures find them repulsive and react to hostility with calming words and a show of peace. Assuming they establish a friendly footing with visitors, they prove to be valuable sources of information about the surrounding territory. In some cases, fleshdregs volunteer to accompany their new acquaintances within a swamp, especially if the fleshdregs seek to relocate.   **Otherworldly Origins.** Scholars who have studied the strange trees conclude they derive from some foreign environment. They are split on whether the creatures come from beyond the stars or migrated from deep within the underworld. The scholars agree fleshdregs serve an environmental niche in their native habitat similar to trees and may be an otherworldly equivalent to Open Game License</description>

    <name>Cacophony</name>
    <text>If three or more flithidirs are within 15 feet of each other, they can use their reactions to start a cacophony. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of one of the flithidirs and that can hear the cacophony must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check. The DC increases by 1 for each flithidir participating in the cacophony to a maximum of DC 16. To join or maintain an existing cacophony, a flithidir must use its bonus action on its turn and end its turn within 15 feet of another flithidir participating in the cacophony. The cacophony ends when less than three flithidir maintain it. A flithidir can still speak and cast spells with verbal components while participating in a cacophony.</text>

  <description>The gnome-like creature flutters from tree to tree, sporting colorful, avian features._   **Avian Fey.** Flithidirs are small fey that embody the bright, chaotic nature of birds. They are slender and keen-eyed with feathery crests and feathered wings. Flithidirs are creatures of contrasts—loud and lively, yet prone to moments of calm wonder; bold and cocky, yet easily startled; able to sing with breathtaking beauty or confuse their foes with earsplitting noise.   **Shapeshifters.** Flithidirs are shapeshifters, able to change into birds or smaller humanoids, and they favor colorful clothes and adornments, even while shapeshifted. Relentlessly curious, flithidirs often take the form of a bird when they encounter strangers, quietly following and studying the creatures. If the strangers are deemed safe and intriguing, the flithidir approaches in a humanoid form to get better acquainted.   **Easily Bored.** Flithidirs tirelessly seek out new things. Some desire new experiences—songs and stories, unusual foods, and sudden discoveries—while others are more covetous, ceaselessly collecting objects they find interesting. Sometimes this greed manifests as a magpie-like desire for shiny things, but a flithidir is also just as likely to be fascinated by items of a certain shape, texture, or color. When a flithidir encounters someone who possesses a thing it wants, it may offer something in exchange— usually a splendid song or acrobatic display—or it may simply request the item with great charm, reacting with frustration or rage if the object is denied to it.</description>

    <text>The fragrant one emits a cloud of sweet-smelling pheromones within 20 feet of it. A giant, humanoid, or beast that starts its turn inside the aura must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature fails the saving throw three times in 1 hour, it is charmed for 1 day and obeys the fragrant one’s verbal or telepathic commands. If the creature suffers harm from the fragrant one or its allies or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

The fragrant one can have no more than six creatures charmed at a time. The fragrant one can end its charm on a creature at any time (no action required).

  <description>A pale yellow and green slug-like creature with a benign expression on its round human face sits atop a large mushroom. Long antennae wave atop its bald head as its languid blue eyes observe its surroundings._   **Fairytale Fey.** A fragrant one is a whimsical and playful creature whose innocent and friendly demeanor hides a cunning intelligence. Fragrant ones feed on companionship and use their magical pheromones to inveigle themselves into the lives of other creatures, particularly woodland humanoids and giants. Strangely, a fragrant one knows nothing of real commitment or friendship, and all of its relationships are built on lies and deceptions.   **Safety in Numbers.** Fragrant ones are relatively weak when alone, barely having enough strength to fend off predators. When in the presence of multiple charmed companions, however, a fragrant one becomes much more of a threat, its body growing thick chitinous plates and its antennae lengthening.</description>

  <description>Frost moles primarily eat meat and supplement their diets with plants that eke out an existence in arctic climates. Though they can overpower prey with their claws, they prefer to ensnare their victims in pits they dig as traps. Since frost moles build their warrens near farms where they can grab more docile livestock, their lairs present a nuisance to those who work the land during the short growing seasons. Creatures capable of taming frost moles find them extremely valuable. Frost mole masters train the moles to excavate treacherous pits around their lairs, protecting the masters from intruders.</description>

A strange, writhing tentacle protrudes slightly from its gaping mouth._   **Unnatural Origin.** Centuries ago, an order of wizards, known as the Covenant of Infinum, found itself in need of slaves and descended upon a nearby human settlement. The order enslaved every villager and conducted magical experiments upon them in the wizards’ remote mountain tower. The wizards were trying to create the perfect servitor race, using the villagers as a baser life form. The experiment failed spectacularly, unleashing a magical transformative wave upon the tower. Many of the wizards managed to escape, but all of the human slaves were caught in the magical chaos and were forever changed into gaunt ones.   **Undead Appearance.** At first glance, gaunt ones appear to be some form of undead creature, leading many to underestimate them. Their skin is pale, shrunken, and withered, and their teeth are yellow and jagged with receded gums.   **Hunger for Hearts.** Gaunt ones have an inherent hunger for hearts and often sit quietly for hours, listening for the heartbeats of nearby creatures. A gaunt one grabs hold of its prey and worms its tentaclelike tongue into the creature’s mouth to extract the creature’s heart. Insatiable, a gaunt one continues to eat the hearts of creatures it finds until there is nothing left to harvest. Lacking readily available food, it moves on.</description>

* Remove Knowledge. Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become hopelessly lost in the ghillie dubh’s forest. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks and takes 50 percent more time on overland travel, even delaying clearheaded companions. 
* Share Knowledge. Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks. The creature can move at a fast pace through forest terrain, and difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn’t cost it extra movement.</text>

  <description>This bipedal creature seems to be a humanoid-shaped mound of leaves and moss given life. Dark pits in its head resemble empty eye sockets._   **Protectors of the Lost.** Ghillie dubhs hail from good-aligned arboreal planes. There, they guide visitors through the sometimes-confounding landscape. They often rescue those who incidentally succumb to the peaceful nature of planar woodlands and might otherwise perish. However, they find their services more useful on the Material Plane where nature is generally more unforgiving. Their desire to help mortals leads them to more extreme climates, with a strong preference for colder weather. Ghillie dubhs find lost travelers and guide these unfortunates to safe places. If a traveler impresses a ghillie dubh with knowledge or a desire for knowledge about the forest, the ghillie dubh gifts the traveler with some of its knowledge.   **Punishment of Transgression.** Likewise, a ghillie dubh expects visitors to the area it oversees to be respectful of the land. Ghillie dubhs lecture mild violators and briefly use nature to inconvenience them, such as by covering paths or removing tracks. More heinous acts—like wantonly slaughtering animals or setting trees ablaze—are met with physical retaliation.   **Part of the Forest.** Ghillie dubhs take on characteristics of the forests they call home to blend in seamlessly with the trees and other plants. They can listen to subtle variations in the trees’ movements to receive early warning about attacks, and they can turn their attention to any part of the forest to ensure no harm is coming to an area.</description>

  <description>Giant honey bees congregate in great swarms and fill hollows in rocky hillsides with their massive wax and honey hives. Far more intelligent than their diminutive cousins, giant honey bees sometimes enter into relationships with bearfolk or other creatures who can help protect the hive in exchange for a small share of the bees’ honey. Unlike a normal honey bee, a giant honey bee who stings a creature doesn’t lose its stinger.   Giant honey bees are rarely idle, often moving in elaborate, waggling dances of spirals and loops. This “dance” is actually a complex language the bees use to share staggeringly accurate directions and information about nearby threats and food sources with the rest of their hive.</description>

  <description>A common threat in canals, lagoons, bayous, and countless other bodies of water, the giant water scorpion is responsible for the deaths of many adventurers exploring waterways. Like most aquatic monsters, giant water scorpions are seldom at the top of the food chain in their native environment, and black dragons in particular enjoy snacking on them. Swamp and water-dwelling humanoids like lizardfolk have been known to use the giant water scorpion’s carapace to create shields or coverings for their tents. The creature’s long tail acts as a breathing tube for it, which is often harvested and used by intrepid explorers and inventors in the creation of diving bells and other apparatuses for traversing the stygian depths.</description>

    <text>If a creature steals one of the gorao-ka’s money pouches, it loses 1d20 gp each time it finishes a long rest. A creature that steals more than one money pouch deducts an extra 1d20 gp for each additional stolen pouch. This effect ends when the thief freely gives double the amount of money it stole to another creature or organization. A gorao-ka carries 1d10 pouches, each containing 1d20 gp.

At any point within the next 1 hour, the creature can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

Alternatively, the bearer of the coin can pass it to another creature of its choice. At any point within the next 8 hours, the new bearer of the coin can roll 2d6 and add the higher result to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</text>

  <description>The wizened, doll-sized woman sits beside a small shrine of bonsai branches. She smiles and reaches into a full pouch, removing a gold coin. She passes the coin with an encouraging nod to the desperate-looking man kneeling before her._   **Small Gods of Substance.** Gorao-ka represent small fortunes of both a physical and spiritual nature. Their shrines can be erected anywhere, but they are commonly found in settlements and widely-traveled areas. Larger settlements have multiple shrines, sometimes one or more per neighborhood, each of which is associated with a different gorao-ka.   **Gentle and Benevolent.** Gorao-ka have a kind look for every person that crosses their path. Each of them has a burning desire to assist people, and they grieve on the occasions that they can’t. The laws governing their kind forbid them from extending aid to someone that hasn’t made an offering at their shrine, though a gorao-ka accepts almost anything in tribute.   **Thieves’ Bane.** Despite their generous natures, gorao-ka have no pity for those who steal from them. Fools who steal from gorao-ka swiftly discover their money inexplicably vanished, and can end up destitute if they don’t make reparations.   **Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>Towering over the frozen landscape, this immense saurian monstrosity possesses a terrifying shark-like head with a multitude of serrated teeth. The monster has three eyes: two soulless black pits and a third larger eye that glows with a freezing blue light._   **Terror of the North.** The legendary graknork is one of the most powerful monsters to roam the endless tundra and taiga of the north and is feared by all who live in the rugged and frozen expanses of the world. Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world.   **Great Blue Eye.** While the graknork’s raw physical prowess is justifiably feared, the aspect of its appearance that causes the greatest consternation is its great, freezing blue eye. Its eye is said to possess terrible and wondrous powers, including seeing through illusions, freezing souls outright, and causing everlasting blizzards. Most of these tales are mere fancy and hearsay spun by northern tribesmen, yet there is no denying that the graknork’s central eye is a fearsome weapon.</description>

  <description>This draconic skeleton is surround by a nimbus of light, colored in such a way as to betray the undead creature’s living origins._   Graveyard dragons form out of the remains of evil dragons killed as part of a cataclysm that claimed the lives of several dragons at the same time, or when their remains are exposed to heavy concentrations of necrotic energy.   **Vindictive Undead.** Graveyard dragons are vengeful, like many other intelligent undead, but they focus their retribution on the ones responsible for their deaths rather than on their own kind. In fact, these undead dragons have a strange sense of protectiveness of other dragons, particularly for the type of dragons they were when they were alive. This sometimes extends to non-evil dragons, but most good-aligned dragons view the existence of graveyard dragons with distaste.   **Intimidating Appearance.** Graveyard dragons are particularly appealing to powerful undead as guardians for their lairs. A graveyard dragon’s skeletal appearance is often enough to scare away most adventurers and tomb robbers. Unlike a more traditional animated skeleton, however, the graveyard dragon is capable of handling the few tomb robbers foolhardy enough to face it.   **Undead Nature.** The graveyard dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The ground erupts into a scrambling flood of orcs, their pale skin decorated with swirls of black resin._   Dwelling deep beneath the ground, gray orcs move in a dark world, only drawn toward the surface by their innate hatred of arcane defilement.   **Drawn to Magical Corruption.** Gray orcs are drawn to areas where magic is frequently used or locations marred by magical pollution. Scholars believe the orcs’ ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.   **Synchronized Tribes.** Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.</description>

  <description>A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human—but seemingly made of fine spider silk—moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._   **Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.   **Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.   **Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna’s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.    #### Lunarchidna Moon Phase  Moon Phase  Statistics  Daytime, new, or crescent moon  Open Game License</description>

  <description>The sound of metal clinking against metal becomes a deafening cacophony as a swirling cloud of coins mindlessly hunts for more valuables to absorb into its ever-expanding mass._   Located in densely-populated areas, the greed swarm is solely focused on increasing the size of its hovering collection of valuables. Able to differentiate between objects of value and worthless junk, the swarm stalks streets and sewers alike. Its movements are erratic; the cloud swells and contracts in quick succession, repositioning itself in jerky, stilted bursts of motion.//   **Bad Penny.** The swarm consists of normal, mundane valuables animated by a magical master coin. Often mistaken as a standard regional coin, this master coin is created in a dark ritual to serve as a vessel for pure, ceaseless avarice. If the master coin is destroyed or separated from the swarm, the remaining coins return to their normal inert state and fall to the ground.   **All that Glitters.** The master coin cannot exert its power without a large enough supply of valuables to control in close proximity. Bank and vault owners who fail to screen incoming coinage for latent magical properties may find themselves in need of adventurers to discreetly quell a storm of their accumulated wealth. Wishing wells and public fountains are also common homes for greed swarms.   **Construct Nature.** The greed swarm doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A jagged shard of smoky translucent crystal, approximately the size and mass of a housecat, hovers silently across the field._   **Strange Families.** Grimmlets reproduce by creating near clones of themselves when injured by arcane energy, leading them to quickly gather in large familial swarms. Strangely, a grimmlet can only swarm with other grimmlets created from the same progenitor grimmlet, which leads the swarm. Not long after the swarm forms, it disperses, each grimmlet moving on to create new swarms through magic injury.   **Whispering Menace.** Grimmlets do not speak. In fact, they never communicate with other creatures via any known form of language or telepathy, though they do seem to understand creatures of the Void. Despite this, the air around a grimmlet mutters and whispers at all times in a foul-sounding invocation. When the creature uses its innate magic, these whispers rise in volume slightly, giving canny listeners a split-second warning that something, likely unpleasant, is about to occur.</description>

Smaller, mutualistic predators swim throughout the lair, keeping it well protected.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the gulper behemoth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the gulper behemoth can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The gulper behemoth commands deep sea eels and plants to constrict a target it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round. * The gulper behemoth commands plants and coral to shoot boiling water at up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn’t grant resistance against this damage.</description>

  <description>A tall, gangly humanoid creature with pale-green skin and the head of a mackerel strides out of the water. It wears a loose-fitting tunic and carries a clamshell in its long, spindly hands._   **Diplomatic Fey.** Haleshi are fey that act as intermediaries between fey who live on the land and those who live in oceans and rivers, settling disputes that arise between the two groups. Haleshi are impartial in their rulings and prefer to make decisions based on evidence rather than rumor and speculation. The job of an haleshi is a difficult one due to the chaotic and unpredictable nature of many fey, but they usually receive the backing of the fey lords, particularly the River King, whose court they frequent, and the Bear King, who admires their stoic adherence to duty in the face of adversity.   **Clam Riders.** Haleshi have a mystical connection with ordinary clams and similar mollusks and are able to use mollusks to magically transport themselves from one body of water to another.   **Food-Lovers.** While haleshi have little to do with humanoids in their role as fey diplomats and judges, they have a predilection for human and elven cuisine, particularly desserts such as apple pies and strawberry tartlets. Some fey try to bribe haleshi with human or elven sweets, only to find that the fey are all but incorruptible.</description>

    <name>Detachable Head</name>
    <text>As a bonus action, the hantu penanggal detaches its head. The head trails entrails like flexible tentacles. While detached, the head and body act independently from each other on the same initiative, and each has hp equal to half its hp before detaching its head. Its statistics remain the same in both forms, except the body loses its truesight and gains blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.

The head and body can use the whole form’s innate spellcasting trait, expending daily uses as normal. The two forms can rejoin into the fiend’s whole form as a bonus action if they are within 5 feet of each other. If the head is destroyed while it is detached, the body also perishes. If the body is destroyed while the head is detached, the head has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until it acquires a new body. A creature within 30 feet of the penanggal and that can see the detachment must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

Just seeing a harbinger causes most creatures to flee in terror, and few are willing or able to face one in battle. Creatures allied with a harbinger must also fear its terrible wrath, as it is not against skewering its allies on its many spikes to rejuvenate itself in the heat of battle.   **Forged by Demons.** The first harbingers were created in vast demonic forges by a powerful demon prince to use against his enemies. Since then, the construction process has passed to other demon princes and evil gods that delight in devastation and mayhem.   **Construct Nature.** A harbinger doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

A hebi-doku claims to care little for the veneration of non-serpents, but it knows it will cease to exist without their gifts.   **Toxic Shrines.** To summon a hebi-doku, a heart stilled by snake venom must be laid at the foot of a low altar built of mongoose bones.   **Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <text>As a bonus action, the heggarna can attach its lamprey-like maw to a sleeping creature. The target’s Charisma score is reduced by 1d4 when the heggarna first attaches to it. The target’s Charisma score is then reduced by 1 for each hour the heggarna stays attached. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest at least 24 hours after the heggarna reduced its Charisma.

While attached, the heggarna fills the target’s dreams with nightmares. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn’t gain any benefit from its current rest. If the target succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, it immediately awakens.

The heggarna can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it reduces the target’s Charisma by 8 or if the target dies.</text>

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the heggarna could appear to have fur, but someone touching it would feel its slippery flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the heggarna is disguised.</text>
  </action>
  <description>The foul abomination wriggles about on multiple caterpillar-like claspers. It has the jagged, circular maw and slippery body of an oversized leech and the head and coloration of a fierce tiger._   **Night Terrors.** Many sleepers have experienced nightmares in which a shadowy creature was sitting on them, draining them of their vital essence. While most of these experiences are because of some underlying psychological trauma, some are the result of visitations by terrifying creatures of the night. One such creature is the heggarna, a vile aberration that feeds on a creature’s mental energy as it sleeps and infuses the victim’s subconscious with terrible nightmares for its own vile amusement.   **Hidden Fear.** During the day, the heggarna disguises itself as a stray cat, lurking near the homes of potential prey and fleeing with feline-like caution when anyone comes near. Most humanoids overlook simple animals like cats when dealing with a heggarna infestation, but magic can detect the creature’s true appearance. Normal animals react to the heggarna with a strange ferocity, which experienced hunters recognize as a sign of a heggarna.</description>

While trapped, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the helashruu, and it takes 21 (6d6) force damage at the start of each of the helashruu’s turns. The helashruu can have only one creature trapped at a time. A fragmented caricature of the trapped creature appears on the helashruu’s surface while a creature is trapped inside it.

If the helashruu takes 30 or more bludgeoning or thunder damage on a single turn, the helashruu must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or release the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the helashruu. If the helashruu dies, a trapped creature is immediately released into a space within 10 feet of the helashruu.</text>

  <description>An enormous looking glass floats forward, its enormous, warped frame composed of writhing purple tendrils, and its surface covered in dozens of hideous, swirling eyes. Several razor-sharp whips whirl through the air around it._   **Mirrors from Beyond.** The helashruu are bizarre and terrifying aberrations that travel the planes, spreading chaos and destruction. Resembling towering mirrors covered in tentacles and eyes, helashruu defy rational explanation. When they deem it necessary to communicate with other creatures, it is usually through a jumbled mishmash of thoughts with their telepathy, though making sense of what they say is often next to impossible.   **Trapping Gone Astray.** Sages versed in planar lore believe the helashruu were created when a mirror of life trapping swallowed a powerful, deity of chaos and shattered under the strain of the energies it tried to contain. The pieces then scattered across the planes before forming into the first helashruu. The helashruu sometimes trap creatures within themselves, giving credence to this belief. Some sages hypothesize that if all the helashruu were to gather together in one place, they would reform the original mirror, and the evil entity would be released from its confinement. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare and hold nothing but contempt for others of their own kind.</description>

  <description>The butcher strides down the lane, preaching of threshing the chaff from the wheat. Around it, people tear into each other, blind with rage. All the while, the butcher grows in stature and sprouts wicked horns as it revels in the massacre._   Heralds of slaughter are sent by dark gods to foment unrest and agitate mortals into committing barbaric atrocities.   **Provokers of Wrath.** Disguised as a trusted craftsman, a herald of slaughter finds a source of anger in a community and feeds it until it grows, all while pretending to understand and offer solutions to the source. A herald of slaughter fuels the anger of the people by instigating mass culling, revolts, and blood sacrifices. As problems escalate, a herald of slaughter reveals its fiendish form to culminate the savagery in a final, chaotic exaltation of the dark gods.   **Brutality and Blood.** Once a herald of slaughter has been revealed, it assumes its fiendish appearance and wades fanatically into combat. Wielding a massive meat cleaver and rage-inducing magic, a herald of slaughter seeks to destabilize its opponents by inciting blinding fury and pitting comrades against each other.</description>

Strange, luminous forms are seen under rafts, among the trees, and in any dark and empty place.   **Creature of Motion.** The herald of the Void always seems stirred by a breeze, even in an airless space. Nothing short of stopping time itself can change this.   **Folding Infinite Space.** While the herald of the Void seems corporeal, its body displays a strange ability to fold itself in impossible ways, and sometimes it seems to teleport great distances or to summon objects from afar without effort.</description>

  <description>A plump, wingless drake with golden scales and glowing amber eyes lounges on a pile of treasure. When it opens its crooked mouth, molten gold drips from its jaws._   **Avarice Personified.** Hoard drakes are perhaps the most avaricious and lazy of all dragonkind, spending their days lying on huge mounds of copper, silver, and gold pieces, rarely—if ever—venturing out of their lairs. Hoard drakes feed irregularly, gorging themselves on metals, minerals, and the occasional dwarf or goat when hunger finally gets the better of them. Hoard drakes are almost as vain as they are greedy and meticulously clean their scales to a polished gleam that matches their golden treasure. Hoard drakes lust after the hoards of true dragons and sometimes attack small dragons to steal their treasure or take over their lairs.   **Robbers Beware.** Strangely, hoard drakes are docile creatures that are open to conversation with visitors. However, hoard drakes are roused to terrible anger when even the smallest portion of their treasure is taken. At such times, a hoard drake leaves its lair to relentlessly pursue the thief, not resting until its treasure is reclaimed and the offending party is slain and eaten. A hoard drake never gives up any part of its hoard unless threatened with certain death. Even then, it doesn’t rest until the indignity it has suffered has been repaid in full.</description>

  <description>A creature covered in green and brown fur with a horned, frog-shaped head and spikes running along its back and tail stalks forward, its fanged face twisted in a leering grin._   Hodags are carnivorous nocturnal predators that stalk temperate forests, hills, and plains.   **Taste for Domestic Life.** While fierce, hodags prefer to kill easy prey. Many stalk the lands outside farms, villages, and even small cities, attacking livestock, pets, and travelers. Hodags have been known to break down the doors of houses, barns, and other buildings to get at prey inside.   **Solo Hunters until Mating.** Hodags are generally solitary creatures with large territories. Babies are abandoned by their mothers after birth. There is an exception for one week each year in spring just after the end of winter. Hodags within several hundred miles instinctually gather in a prey-filled area, which never seems to be the same place twice. The hodags gorge on as much food as possible and engage in mating rituals. When the week is over, the hodags disperse, returning to their territories.   **Impossible to Train.** Hodags are born with strong predator instincts, which helps the young survive after being left by their mothers. Many believe this same instinct makes hodags impossible to train, but such claims only make them more valuable targets for those who collect exotic pets.</description>

  <description>While the chitinous horn-like protrusion makes holler spiders appear comical, they can use it to release a loud sound, calling their masters when they detect trespassers. Unlike most spiders, holler spiders are easy to domesticate, as they have a friendly disposition toward humanoids. They can be trained to act as sentries that recognize certain colors or livery, or they can be trained to respond to a certain person and sound alarms only when instructed.

  <description>A faint disturbance signifies the presence of something terrible and evil—an unnatural miasma. Suddenly, the hazy air coalesces into a mass of greenish fog with multiple red eyes and a dozen vaporous tentacles._   **Harbingers of Pestilence.** The hongaek is an elemental creature from the most stagnant and fouled regions of the Elemental Plane of Air. Its mere presence serves to strengthen and empower diseases and poisons in its proximity. Hongaeks typically arrive on the Material Plane through planar portals in areas where pestilence and famine are rampant, but they are occasionally summoned by death cults or by those who venerate gods of plague or poison.   **Elemental Hatred.** Hongaeks are thoroughly evil and hate land-dwelling lifeforms like humans and elves. They detest other elemental creatures just as much, and battles between them are not uncommon where their territories on the planes meet.   **Elemental Nature.** The hongaek doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

It brandishes a halberd made of shadow and hisses, “Come forth and be judged!”_   **Strange Great Sins.** In small villages on a festival eve, one villager plays the village’s “sin eater.” Bearing a horse’s skull on a pole and covered by a draping of tattered skins, the sin eater goes door to door with its crew, seeking payment for the householders’ wrongs. The payment usually takes the form of alcohol. As the evening wanes, a drunken procession staggers toward the tavern behind the sin eater. Dark tales relate how, where a terrible wrong has gone unpunished and unpaid, such folk rituals can go awry. The unfortunate sin eater, overwhelmed by a spirit of vengeance, melds with the skull to become a ghastly undead being bent on retribution, a hooden horse.   **The Madness of The Crowd.** If the sin eater has drunken hangers-on when it is transformed, the mob also becomes filled with vengeful spite and swarms around the hooden horse, assaulting any who interfere.

It serves as guardian of these coveted locations, ensuring no particular creature or group takes control of them.   **Luxuriating Fey.** Hverhuldras are not stodgy protectors of their homes. They enjoy the feeling of warmth they experience and believe others should be able to revel in it as well. Provided no violence occurs, hverhuldras are gracious hosts to their hot springs. Some may even encourage visitors to engage in dalliances underwater, using their magic to accommodate those unable to breathe underwater.   **Inured to Cold.** Despite their preference for warm or hot water, hverhuldras are hardened against cold weather. Their bodies generate incredible heat, and they produce copious amounts of steam when they stand in the cold.</description>

  <description>A gaggle of mischievous, rime-covered humanoids, one of which is standing on the shoulders of another, paint hoarfrost patterns on a window._   Wherever the temperature drops below freezing, mobs of ice bogies may appear to unleash their wintry mischief. Enigmatic creatures of ice: the hows and whys of their random arrivals remain a mystery. A group might plague a remote village for an entire winter or pester a yeti for a single afternoon. Whenever frost forms in suspicious places or patterns, ice bogies are likely to blame.   **Japes and Vandalism.** Whether pilfering innocuous items, laying slicks of frost across doorways, or freezing a goat’s eyelids shut while it sleeps, the creatures find delight in pranks and making nuisances of themselves. Capricious and gleeful, they are equal opportunists—seeing little difference between humanoids, beasts, or monstrosities. They find pleasure lurking on the edges of civilization, gathering to play their tricks on unsuspecting pioneers before melting back into the frigid wilds without a trace.   **Vicious Reprisals.** While ice bogies are known to occasionally help lost travelers or return stolen prizes the next day, they have a dangerous side. When provoked, they swarm their opponents in a series of darting attacks from all sides and are known to pelt their enemies with shards of ice plucked from their own bodies in a flurry of hail.</description>

  <description>A humanoid-shaped block of ice lumbers forward on angular legs._   **Visitors from Polar Portals.** Remote polar regions possess their own entrances to the demiplane of ice. Ice elementals emerge from the core of ancient glaciers or rise from foot-thick patches of permafrost. They are aware of portals to their demiplane, but they often choose to traverse terrestrial lands as long as the temperatures remain below freezing. Though not inherently malevolent, they enjoy enclosing warmblooded foes in ice and watching as the creatures freeze.

  <description>An immense, pale-blue, eel-like creature dripping a thick, gelatinous oil rises above the waves. Dozens of tiny eyes blink along its serpentine flanks._   **Giant Elementals.** One of the more unusual denizens of the Elemental Plane of Water, the ikuchi can also be found in the oceans of the Material Plane, hunting the natural fauna and causing havoc for shipping lanes. Though the typical ikuchi is just under a hundred feet long, rumors abound of ikuchi that are hundreds of feet or even miles in length in the largest oceans and the depths of their home plane. Ikuchi are also known as ayakashi in various lands and are sometimes confused with sea serpents.   **Sinker of Boats.** More dangerous than even the size of the ikuchi is the oil it produces almost constantly from its body. This oil is thicker than the surrounding water and impedes the movement of any creature moving through it, even those native to the Elemental Plane of Water. The ikuchi uses its oil to swamp small ships by slithering on board and filling the ship with its oil, gradually causing the ship to sink. Why the ikuchi goes to such lengths to sink watercraft is unknown, as the creatures are highly temperamental and are just as likely to ignore a vessel as they are to go after it.</description>

They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.   **Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements.

  <description>This composite creature combines a ruddy-skinned gnome’s upper body and a hell hound’s reddish black body. Stitches and glowing runes where the gnome and hell hound are fused demonstrate the creature’s unnaturalness._   Infernal centaurs are a response by various cults to the physical might possessed by the centaurs of the nearby plains. Rather than a melding of human and horse, though, these centaurs combine hell-bound gnomes with hell hounds. The composite creature combines gnome cunning with the speed and fiery breath belonging to hell hounds. The ritual that creates an infernal centaur infuses the creature with a peculiar brutality.   **Unnatural.** Infernal centaurs are not naturally occurring. However, as the ritual to create these centaurs improves and spreads among cults, more gnomes who desire hellish power submit to the ritual, increasing the number of these centaurs.</description>

  <description>A towering winged devil looms above, a wicked scimitar in its grasp. Its form shifts subtly, hinting at a deeper secret._   **Infernal Insects.** Infernal swarms are found throughout the Hells. Considered a delicacy, these insects can form a hive mind, which they use to shape their swarm into a massive winged devil whenever they are threatened. The individual insects are bat-winged and have bulging eyes, long spindly legs, and a carapace covered in poisonous barbs.   **Hellish Poison.** Infernal swarms feed on carrion, injecting the carcasses with a poison that liquifies tissue. This same poison coats their barbs, which painfully dissuades predators.   **Sensitive to Sound.** Loud noises disorient the insects and interrupt their coordination, temporarily scattering the individuals. However, it is rare to encounter these silent killers hunting on their own, and if one is spotted, there are certain to be many more to follow.</description>

They follow their own ideals of beauty and excitement, disregarding their angelic cousins’ insistence on goodness and truth. Irids delight in sneaking around, listening for gossip or revealed secrets, then invisibly whispering exaggerations of in the ears of those who will help spread such gossip.   **Colorful and Shallow.** Irids are iridescent, changing the color of the light they shed throughout the day. They are drawn to the brightest colors the world has to offer. To them, evil is synonymous with ugliness, and they resist fighting or hurting anything they find beautiful.</description>

    <text>One humanoid or beast the jack of strings can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become magically linked to the jack’s marionette. This link appears as a barely perceptible string between the jack’s marionette and the target. A linked creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the link on a success.

While a target is linked, the jack of strings can use its reaction at the start of the target’s turn to control the linked target. The jack of strings can make the target move, manipulate objects, attack, or take other purely physical actions. The jack can’t make the target cast spells. While controlled, the target moves awkwardly and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the target receives a suicidal command from the jack of strings, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

The jack of strings can have only one target linked at a time. If it links another, the effect on the previous target ends. If a creature dies while linked to the jack’s marionette, the creature’s body becomes a wooden puppet that resembles the creature.</text>

  <description>Clad in fine clothes of black and red, the tall, slim figure steps forward. With a clawed hand grasping a crossbar, it makes its eyeless marionette dance.

It is adept at tailoring its performances to the crowd, switching effortlessly between charming plays, ribald performances, satirical pantomimes, and terrifying tales. During these performances, the jack of strings can take control of a creature in the audience to enact justice in the form of humiliation, torture, or even death. The jack is sometimes hired by fey nobility to enact such justice on rivals.   **Uncanny Valley.** The jack of strings takes control of its victims by establishing a link between the victim and one of its marionettes. When it establishes the link, the marionette becomes lifelike while the jack’s victim takes on a wooden appearance. The puppet gains the victim’s eyes, which disappear from the victim’s face.   **Masters of Puppets.** Jacks of strings have several marionettes at their disposal. Aside from the first, which it painstakingly crafts itself, the jack’s puppets derive from victims who perish while linked to the jack’s puppet. Jacks harvest their prey in the mortal realm under the guise of a traveling entertainer and typically target people who won’t be missed.</description>

They are no strangers to the plateaus of Leng, and its denizens give wandering kachlians a wide berth.   **Eater of Souls.** The kachlian consumes the souls of creatures, preferring intelligent and enlightened prey. When it consumes a creature, the creature’s soul is torn to pieces. The kachlian absorbs the parts it considers valuable into its own being and discards the rest.

  <description>Three figureheads rise from the tattered sails and anchor chain that drape the crab’s carapace. As the behemoth clacks its claws, the maidens depicted on the figureheads begin to wail._   Few monsters strike more fear into the hearts of sailors than the keelbreaker crab. These enormous crustaceans prey on ships caught in shallow water and decorate their shells with the wreckage left behind. Keelbreaker crabs are drawn to ships carrying magical cargo, as well as to the enchanted, living figureheads that often adorn such vessels.   **Living Figureheads.** The wails of a keelbreaker’s figureheads drive most who hear them mad. However, a figurehead recovered intact from a crab might be convinced to reveal the location of a hidden treasure or even chart a course to the native harbor of the ship it formerly adorned.</description>

  <description>A thick, snakelike creature made of thousands of blades of kelp rises above the water’s surface. Flyaway blades swirl from the primary mass as the creature winds itself around its hapless prey._   Kelp eels were accidentally created by merfolk arcanists who desired to protect their community from the myriad threats facing them. They attempted to bring the kelp forests near their settlement to life to entangle attackers, slowing them long enough to allow the merfolk to repel them. Instead, the first kelp eels were born as the blades of kelp wove themselves into massive eely forms that ravaged the very community they were created to protect.   **Serpents of the Shallows.** Since their creation, kelp eels have spread across the ocean. Forests of sentient kelp grow in ocean shallows, scarcely different to the casual observer from any other marine jungle. As the kelp matures, the blades wind around the thallus and eventually detach from its holdfast as a full-grown kelp eel. The kelp eel then moves on to an unclaimed shallow and attempts to create a new forest.   **Mariners’ Nightmares.** The presence of a kelp eel is a blight upon people whose livelihoods depend on the ocean. The voracious eels are known to overturn boats and to drag their occupants to a watery grave. Kelp-entwined humanoid remains are common on the floor of kelp eel forests. Experienced sailors sometimes chum the waters as they approach a kelp forest, hoping to attract other large ocean predators to distract the local kelp eels.   **Deep Hunters.** While kelp eels live and breed in shallower waters, it isn’t uncommon for them to hunt the ocean deeps if fertilizer is proving scarce near their forest. Knowledgeable mariners know that the presence of dead whales, sharks, and giant squid in shallow waters could be an indicator of kelp eel activity.</description>

  <description>A wingless reptile with a long, lithe body and short, powerful legs scurries down an alley after a rat. Its pointed snout darts into the hole where its prey disappeared._   The keyhole dragonette is a small, wingless dragon with flexible bands of large, overlapping scales, a pointed snout, and a wide, flat tail.   **Urban Exterminators.** Keyhole dragonettes were magically bred to be adept at entering closed-off or hard-to-reach places. Their original purpose was to seek out and destroy nests of rats and other city-dwelling vermin, but they regularly find themselves employed as living lockpicks. Their sensitivity to vibrations helps them find prey no matter where it is hidden, and their long, deft tongues enable them to pick even the most complex of locks. Dragonettes have difficulty delineating between pests and pets, and they sometimes consume the furry companions of the people whose homes they are ridding of vermin.   **Big Eaters.** Belying their small frames, keyhole dragonettes have voracious appetites and can consume a variety of foods. Aside from meat, they enjoy fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Keyhole dragonettes with easy access to sugary foods often develop a sweet tooth.   **Loyal Companions.** Guards, wilderness scouts, and rogues of all types often see the value in taking a keyhole dragonette as a companion. Young dragonettes are easy to train and eagerly bond with people, quickly becoming steadfast friends with their caretakers. If the person a dragonette has bonded to dies or leaves, the dragonette becomes despondent. The depression can last for years if something doesn’t occur to lift the creature’s spirits.</description>

Six long red tongues emerge from this orifice, each as thick as a man’s torso and ending in a razor-sharp point._   **The Hills Have Tongues.** The khodumodumo is one of the apex predators of the hills and badlands in which it lives, disguising itself as a moderately-sized hillock to lure creatures closer before animating and impaling them on one of its many tongues. While not evil, the khodumodumo is a voracious predator that constantly needs to eat, and it attempts to devour just about anything that comes within reach.   **Rite of Passage.** Slaying a khodumodumo in single combat is often considered a rite of passage for a fire giant seeking to contest the leadership of a clan, especially because the creature is naturally resistant to fire. Powerful red dragons have also been known to hunt khodumodumos for sport.</description>

  <description>Blanketed in a veil of mist, an enormous, centipede-like creature sifts its way through the swamp, the severed tail of a wyvern gripped tightly within its jaws._   Whenever an unnatural mist suddenly arises, some believe it to be the sign of a kirikari. Though they’re rare and solitary creatures, kirikari are considered highly dangerous due to their heightened aggression and territorial behavior.   **Ambush Predators.** Few can spot a kirikari in hiding, as it appears as little more than a collapsed tree concealed in fog. It then waits patiently for its prey to draw near—before striking out at them with its lightning-fast bite.   **Symbiotic Relationship.** The mist that covers a kirikari’s body comes from a unique type of mold that adheres to its carapace. The mold secretes an acid that evaporates harmlessly shortly after being exposed to air. The kirikari uses this mist to conceal itself and disorient its prey. Despite being natural-born swimmers, kirikari tend to avoid swimming in ocean waters, as exposure to salt quickly kills its mold.   **Wyvern Hunters.** Though unusual for its behavior, kirikari have been known to travel incredible distances to hunt down wyverns. Some scholars theorize that the toxins within a wyvern’s body are a necessary component in the maintenance of a kirikari’s mold.</description>

  <description>A man of supernatural physique swings his mighty hammer with the ease and abandon of a child wielding a fallen tree branch. Beneath his ruined tabard, swirling runes and sigils dance across an impossibly muscular frame._   Once ordinary warriors, these towering behemoths have been scourged by wild and unpredictable magic that lingers in forgotten and forbidden parts of the world.   **Revised Beyond Recognition.** Perhaps a paladin claims a trophy from an ancient and unknowable force from beyond the stars, after routing a dungeon of its followers— and slowly, the trophy changes him. In the heat of combat, a simple swordsman might quaff the wrong potion and be spontaneously transformed by an errant wizard’s experimental brew. Whatever their origins, they now walk the world as hulking abominations, gifted strength unimaginable in an ironic reflection of their former selves.   **Born of Boons.** Although many knights ab-errant may be altered after exposure to unpredictable arcane sorcery, some were created by divine magic. These may be devotees of trickster gods, or ones that are especially cruel, or they may have prayed to innocuous deities in ways that were unorthodox or otherwise wanting.</description>

Some sages speculate that it was an early attempt by a wizard to infuse life on the Material Plane with elemental essence. Others theorize it is the disastrous byproduct of spell experimentation on an extra-planar creature. Whatever the truth, these strange beings have multiplied and spread, posing a deadly hazard to those who explore the deep caves of the world.   **Reproduction.** When a lambent witchfyre has consumed enough organic material, it will seek an isolated place in which to reproduce. It then divides itself into two new lambent witchfyres, each starting with half the parent’s hit points. The offspring then go their separate ways, seeking more life to devour</description>

  <description>In swampy areas where food is plentiful, leeches gather together in swarms numbering in the hundreds to hunt prey. When their food supply is diminished, the leeches often turn on each other, effectively destroying the swarm. The scent of blood attracts leech swarms, and they easily locate warm-blooded prey. Victims who move out of a leech swarm are not safe, as several leeches remain attached and continue to drain blood until they are removed. These hangers-on are adept at locating hard-to-reach places on their prey as they wriggle into gaps in armor or crawl into boots. Their victims must spend extra time to locate and remove them.</description>

  <description>A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human—but seemingly made of fine spider silk—moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._   **Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.   **Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.   **Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna’s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.    #### Lunarchidna Moon Phase  Moon Phase  Statistics  Daytime, new, or crescent moon  Open Game License</description>

  <description>The light drake is a small, bulky dragon with two legs and two wings. It has glowing yellow eyes, and light reflects easily off its golden scales._   **Light Bringers.** Light drakes are obsessed with bringing light into dark places, and often inhabit the darkest parts of the world. They use their light to aid lost travelers and defeat the denizens of the darkest parts of the world. They are regularly hunted by such denizens, who offer large rewards for their golden hides.   **Social Trinket-Collectors.** Light drakes are social creatures that live in small, glowing colonies in deep caverns. Like their larger cousins, they enjoy collecting trinkets, though they prefer objects made of bright metals or iridescent stones. They often adorn themselves with such trinkets and use their light magic to make the trinkets shine. Light drakes tend to sleep together in piles for warmth and light in the cold darkness, which has led to many a thief inadvertently stumbling into a colony of the jewelry-coated sleeping drakes after mistaking them for a pile of glittering treasure.   **Undead Slayers.** Light drakes despise undead and any creatures that use light, or the absence of light, to prey on innocents.

They may be inclined to wander from place to place or set up shop in metropolises, offering their services to create or unlock barriers of any kind.   **Professional Rivalry.** Each locksmith has a distinct appearance and personality, but they all share the same skill set. A locksmith instantly recognizes the handiwork of another locksmith. When a locksmith encounters a barrier constructed by another of its kind, it is compelled to break the barrier or build a superior version. A locksmith hired to undo the work of one of its fellows often volunteers for the task free of charge.   **Key Features.** Locksmiths are unique in appearance, but all share a generally humanoid shape. Regardless of other details, they all possess empty keyholes where a human nose would typically be. The key that fits this lock is responsible for imbuing the locksmith with its consciousness. Locksmiths build incredibly complex hidden vaults to hide away these treasured keys.   **Construct Nature.** The locksmith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A grey mound of flesh scuttles forward on mismatched limbs, its five heads trilling along on bone flutes. All the while, a harrowing tune plays from the column of pipes rising from its core._   Mad pipers are the heralds of the Great Old Ones, a sign that a cult is getting close to achieving their goals. Cultists receive visions from their masters, filling their dreams with the esoteric rituals needed to create a mad piper. In short order, the cult gathers the components and creates these creatures, typically one for each cell of the cult. When the time comes for the cult to do battle, the mad pipers follow, inspiring the faithful with the alien songs of the Great Old Ones.   **The Ritual.** During the ritual, five humanoids, one of which must be a musician of some kind, are tied to a set of bagpipes made from an ogre’s bones and stomach. The ritual liquefies the humanoids, who fall into each other as all but their limbs and heads dissolve into a mass of grey flesh. Their minds, souls, and bodies forcefully merged, they start to play.   **Pets and Mascots.** Mad pipers aren’t naturally evil. Most are made from commoners, resulting in relatively docile and loyal creatures that imprint quickly onto cult members, who in turn often come to treat these abominations as pets. More violent and powerful mad pipers can be made from powerful, evil humanoids, though they are harder to control and often hostile to their creators.   **True Pipers.** Scholars speculate that the mad pipers are modelled after the heralds of the Crawling Chaos, and that it was he who gifted the first ritual to mortals on behalf of all Great Old Ones.   **Construct Nature.** The mad piper doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>Eight tentacles reach out from the scorched body of this unusual octopus-like creature. Glowing yellow, orange, and red patches smolder on its skin, like embers flaring to life._   **Elemental Bodies.** Magma octopuses are creatures that physically resemble the marine animals for which they are named, but they make their homes in lava, swimming through it as easily as aquatic octopuses swim through water. Born in the fiery seas of the Plane of Fire long ago, many magma octopuses wandered to the Material Plane through various portals and thinned barriers between the planes. They exist throughout the world, particularly in underground caverns with open lava flows, within the craters of some volcanoes, and swimming through underground networks of magma.   **Intelligent.** Magma octopuses live simple lives with a quiet intelligence that slightly surpasses that of aquatic octopuses. They have no language and cannot communicate verbally. They are known to recognize individuals from other species and remember individuals that might have caused them pain or helped them out of a bad situation. Magma octopuses only fight others if they are attacked first, but they can become extremely territorial if intruders tread too close to home. They have a fondness for fire-based magic and sometimes can be recruited to serve as guardians for wizards, efreeti, and other powerful, fiery creatures.   **Elemental Nature.** A magma octopus doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

* Pull. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 5 feet of the magnetic elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the metal items worn or carried by it stick to the magnetic elemental. A creature that is made of metal or is wearing metal armor and that fails the saving throw is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). If the item is a weapon and the wielder can’t or won’t let go of the weapon, the wielder is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). A stuck object can’t be used. Grappled and stuck creatures and objects move with the elemental when it moves. A creature can take its action to remove one creature or object from the elemental by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The magnetic elemental’s Armor Class increases by 1 for each creature grappled in this way. 
* Push. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 10 feet of the elemental must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the elemental. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. A creature grappled by the elemental has disadvantage on this saving throw.</text>

  <description>The large, smooth rock stands, the air around it humming with energy. As it walks, nearby daggers, lanterns, and buckled boots move to follow it._   Magnetic elementals spontaneously appear where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Air. They are magnetized, rocky creatures capable of switching their polarity to repel attacks and pull enemies closer.   **Smooth Stone.** Magnetic elementals are worn smooth by the elemental air that creates them. They are able to harness this air to fly, and, when on the Material Plane, they occupy areas where vast swaths of stone are exposed to the sky, such as mountain peaks and deep canyons.   **Iron Summons.** Spellcasters who want to conjure a magnetic elemental must mix iron shavings into the soft clay. Such spellcasters must take caution, however, as the elementals often inadvertently attract the armor and weapons of those nearby.   **Elemental Nature.** The magnetic elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._   Malleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.   **Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature’s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.   **Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.   **Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.   **Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.</description>

  <description>Gnarled roots reaching deep into the muck act as legs for this group of trees conjoined into a sentient being._   **Ancient Grove Guardians.** Mangrove treants provide shelter and a resource-rich environment for many creatures. They extend their roots into the water, where several species of fish thrive. Biting and stinging insects, most notably mosquitos, dart about in cloud-like formations near the water’s surface. Arboreal animals nest high among the treants’ boughs mostly removed from the depredations of the insects. Unlike their forest cousins, these swampland treants are more concerned with the safety of those under their protection and less concerned with the overall health of the swamp. They decisively react to direct threats to themselves and the creatures within their boughs and roots, but they may not act if something endangers an area outside their immediate groves.   Mangrove treants continue to grow throughout their extraordinarily long lives, which can reach millennia if they see no external disruptions. The treants also add ordinary mangrove trees into their gestalt, incorporating the trees’ ecosystems into its whole.   **Friend to Lizardfolk.** While a mangrove treant is generally wary of civilization, it befriends Open Game License</description>

  <description>A skeletal mare speaks in constant rhyme, its jaws moving as if something were puppeteering it._   **Unwelcome Lodger.** A mari lwyd seeks entry into a home, where it demands to be treated as if it were a guest. Though it doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep, it consumes as much as a horse of its size and requires bedding that is comfortable, clean, and large enough to suit its frame. Despite its apparently baleful nature, the mari lwyd does not seek to harm its hosts, physically or financially, and demands only what they can comfortably provide. It defends itself if attacked, reciting rhymes beseeching its hosts to calm themselves.   A mari lwyd may accompany itself with a “retinue” of skeletons. It refuses to animate zombies, because it doesn’t wish to trouble its hosts with the smell of rotting flesh. It also politely refuses hospitality on the behalf of its cohorts.   **Expelled by Rhyme.** Other than through its physical destruction, the only way to rid oneself of a mari lwyd is to win a rhyming battle. It speaks only in rhyme, often changing languages for the best rhyme scheme between verses, which may provide a clue to those inconvenienced by the mari lwyd. It is especially appreciative of clever rhymes. The mari lwyd usually incorporates winning rhymes into its repertoire. Should a mari lwyd revisit a location, the inhabitants must come up with an even better rhyme to oust the creature.   The mari lwyd takes more conventional methods of turning away undead as an affront. If affected by a cleric’s turning attempt, it leaves for the duration and waits for the cleric to exit the premises before returning and increasing its demands for hospitality.   **Undead Nature.** A mari lwyd doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._   Malleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.   **Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature’s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.   **Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.   **Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.   **Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.</description>

  <description>A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._   Malleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.   **Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature’s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.   **Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.   **Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences.

Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape.

  <description>This fantastic creature is almost uniformly circular in shape, its bizarre form composed of six pairs of bright silver hawk wings flapping in perfect unison. Despite its odd appearance, the creature moves gracefully through the air._   **Ordered Forms.** The circular bodies of these bizarre, spherical celestials are surrounded by six identical wings of burnished silver. Many angels like devas and planetars see moonkites as the perfect unity of form and function, and often extol their virtues to mortals when trying to convince them of the grandeur of the heavens. Moonkites themselves rarely communicate, but when they do, their wings vibrate in time with their words.   **Heavenly Steeds.** Though most celestials do not ride mounts nor use creatures like pegasi and unicorns as steeds, moonkites sometimes serve as mounts for powerful celestial generals and heroes, especially those that do not possess a humanoid form. The moonkite can outfly most other creatures, and it is particularly hardy against the powers of demons and devils, making it a valuable mount to many celestials. Celestials riding a moonkite never treat it as a lesser creature, instead often confiding in the moonkite or asking for its opinion.   **Gifts from Above.** When the world is in dire peril from a powerful chaotic or evil threat, moonkites have been known to assist good-aligned heroes as steeds. Any mortal that gains a moonkite as an ally must uphold the tenets of truth, heroism, and generosity, lest it lose the celestial’s assistance.   **Immortal Nature.** The moonkite doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

The dryads have a particular dislike for dwarves, kobolds, and others who make their living mining mountains.</description>

  <description>The pitiless eyes of this elven creature are black as pitch with neither white nor iris._   **Born to Hunt.** Mountain nymphs claim to be the children of gods associated with hunting and the moon. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but they are renowned as being some of the best stalkers and trappers among the fey. Newly created mountain nymphs, wearing leathers and carrying yew bows, form on the mountainside, fully-grown. The nymphs carry no arrows; every time they put a finger to any bowstring, a nocked arrow appears.   **Despoilers of Despoilers.** Mountain nymphs despise mortals who disrupt the natural order. Those who take or use more natural resources than they need while in a mountain nymph’s territory risk becoming the target of her wrath. The raising of a settlement in a mountain nymph’s territory will attract her immediate attention. The ruins of a failed mountain settlement may be the work of a mountain nymph that has taken umbrage at the community’s excessive use of the local timber and ore.   **Relentless Stalkers.** Little can be done to deter a mountain nymph once it has set its sights on a quarry. They have been known to track their prey far from their native mountains, across continents and into mortal cities. When a nymph catches up to her mark, she harries it without mercy or remorse. A nymph’s mark, assuming it has done nothing to offend or harm the nymph, can throw the nymph off its tail by exiting her territory and leaving tribute of freshly hunted meat and strong drink.</description>

  <description>These large creatures stand upright, with exceptionally powerful legs that end in cloven hooves. Their upper bodies are muscular beneath their snowy-white fur, and their heads resemble those of goats._   **Dwellers of Mountains.** Mountain striders are most at home in the mountains. They live among the peaks, climbing seemingly impossible slopes to make their homes in the caves and burrows they dig near the tops. Ages ago, they had amicable relations with nearby settlements, but their aggressive behavior and boorish attitudes led to conflicts with the populace. They were subsequently made to withdraw from civilization as a result. In the years since, they have become an insular people, fearful of outsiders and resentful of civilization.   **Communal.** Mountain striders live in communal groups that travel the mountains, moving with the seasons. They are highly protective of each other and go into a brief rage when one of their number falls. Their nomadic and overly protective natures occasionally bring them into conflict with dwarves, though the two don’t actively hunt each other.   **Bleating Communication.** The weather on the highest mountain peaks can turn at a moment’s notice, separating family groups within minutes. The mountain striders adapted to such dangers by developing complex bleating calls. Over time, these calls became part of the mountain striders’ culture, seeing use outside of emergency situations. The calls range from simple notifications of an individual’s location or health to short songs identifying family affiliation and lineage.</description>

    <text>The murgrik makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the murgrik, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the murgrik’s turns. The murgrik can only have one creature swallowed at a time.

If the murgrik takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the murgrik must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the murgrik. If the murgrik dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

  <description>This reptilian creature is built like an alligator with two extra mouths: one affixed to a stalk between its eyes and one toothy maw stretched over its belly. A batlike membrane connects its forelimbs to its body, and a tail made up of a dozen spinning tentacles propels the abomination in flight._   **Marshy Nightmares.** Murgriks are consummate hunters and prefer to prey on intelligent creatures. They relish the fear their appearance provokes, and they augment this fear by generating terrifying wails from the stalks on their heads. Once they smell blood, they relentlessly attack and pursue prey until they or their prey die.   **Corrupted Alligators.** Occasionally, deep parts of swamps cross planar boundaries into the Abyss. Those who study murgriks believe the creatures are ordinary alligators warped by their proximity to that plane. Their cruelty and preference for intelligent prey both lend credence to the notion that the Abyssa has influenced their mutations.   **Afraid of Herons.** The only known way to deter a murgrik from attacking is to introduce a heron, real or illusory. The reason a murgrik retreats from herons is a mystery, but it may point to the existence of a demonic bird that preys on murgriks.</description>

  <description>Dressed in clean, dark robes, its claws swirling in arcane gestures, the pale reptilian sends a bolt of energy from the Void at its foes._   Satarre mystics are creatures with tight awareness of nearby living creatures’ fates. They rely on magic and the ability to speak words of decay to control lesser creatures. Mystics’ minds are always turned to destruction and death, though they hold their own lives more dear than that of their fellow satarres, be they non-combatant drones, rampaging destroyers, or others.   **Easily Distracted.** Satarre mystics are known for their ability to ponder and cogitate on larger concerns, even in the midst of a conversation with strangers or a battle with foes. Sometimes these distractions lead them to a great insight and a clever countermove; other times they are easily surprised, captured, or fooled by a shining bit of magic or an unknown arcane device.   **Perpetual Incantations.** Satarre mystics seem to somehow maintain a steady stream of muttered sounds. Sometimes these take a brief physical form, such as a glowing rune of destruction that circles a mystic’s head or drifts from its maker and falls apart in midair.   **Planar Lore and Tools.** Satarre mystics are well-versed in angelic, elemental, and fiendish magic and other arcana, although they do not perform all of these themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command elemental or fiendish minions using Void Speech.</description>

  <description>The old fable How Nuizamo Lost His Knife suggests every blade that has been used to kill is actually a naizu-ha in its native form. This is untrue, but the naizu-ha enjoy the myth and perpetuate it whenever possible._   **Daggers Personified.** The naizu-ha are the act of violence perpetrated by small blades given form. Dealings with naizu-ha are fraught with danger. Initially presumed to be good allies in battle, it was quickly discovered that they couldn’t be controlled in a pitched combat and eagerly lashed out at anything that came into reach. Most often, naizu-ha are summoned to assassinate specific targets.   **Impartial Betrayers.** A naizu-ha has no loyalty to anything but its own desire for blood and pain. If dispatched to kill someone, a naizu-ha can be coerced to switch sides with a promise that their new task will involve more violence than the current job does. They have no patience for subtle work or trickery that involves more than a quick feint. A favorite tactic of naizu-ha is to fulfill a contract, collect whatever payment has been agreed upon, and immediately murder the initial contractor.   **Bloody Biers.** To summon a naizu-ha, the blood of no fewer than three humanoids must be splashed on a stand forged of fused blades. If the petitioner uses their own blood in the ceremony, they have advantage on any ability checks they make to treat with the naizu-ha.   **Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <name>Spine Trap</name>
    <text>With 10 minutes of work, the nharyth can create a web of nearly transparent spines in a 20-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web of spines layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain, and the spines forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them.

A creature that starts its turn in the web of spines or that enters the web during its turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or 1d4 spines stick to it. At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each spine stuck to it. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove 1d4 spines. If a creature starts its turn with more than 4 spines stuck to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

  <description>A hideous mass of coiling intestines undulates, ejecting thin, transparent spears of some resinous material from its many orifices. The creature makes a wet slithering sound as it moves unsettlingly through the air._   **Foulness in Motion.** The nharyth defies gravity with its every movement, as it pulls itself through the air with its mass of intestine-like appendages. The creature does not seem to possess any natural means of propulsion and can even fly through areas where there is no magic.   **Creations of Madness.** Most scholars believe nharyth were created in some insane magical experiment. Others believe they are the spawn of some yet-unknown horror between the stars. Whatever the case, they are clearly not part of the natural ecosystem.</description>

Settlements often form around such oases, and occasional disappearances are accepted as the norm.   **Sand and Water Dwellers.** Oasis keepers lurk by the edge of the water and wait for an opportune time to use their stingers. After they strike, they pull their meal to the water’s depths to feast. Oasis keepers occasionally travel into underground rivers to mate, but they are otherwise fairly sedentary and solitary.</description>

  <description>The ogre steps forward with a lop-sided gait. As it approaches, it rises up, revealing it is actually an abomination of ogre torsos held together by necromantic power._   Special torments await the depraved souls that devised these unholy, undead amalgamations. An ogrepede is comprised of an unknown number of ogre torsos and heads stitched together, with arms erupting from the mass seemingly at random. Watching it skitter haphazardly about a battlefield is almost hypnotic, right until it reaches its prey and rises to attack.   **Vicious Louts.** Mixing and animating ogre parts does nothing to improve their legendary tempers. Even more so than ogres, ogrepedes seek out things to destroy. The more beautiful the creature or object, the more satisfaction the ogrepede derives from its destruction. The lair of the rare ogrepede that has slipped its master’s bonds is full of its debased treasures and, in some instances, the mutilated but still-living victims of their assaults.   **Noisy Wanderers.** People are rarely surprised by the arrival of an ogrepede. Unless specifically commanded not to by their creator, ogrepedes emit a constant haunting moan, as though the creature laments all it has lost. Even if told to be silent, ogrepedes are not quiet. Their fat fingers drum noisily at the ground and their bodies slam gracelessly into corridor walls as they careen along on their duties.   **Poor Allies.** Ogrepedes have difficulty getting along with other creatures, including other ogrepedes. Vestiges of the craven instincts the ogres possessed in life remain after death, causing the ogrepede to lash out at any creature near it, particularly if the target is already wounded. Even when commanded to work with other creatures by their masters, it is merely a matter of when, not if, an ogrepede will attack its companions; the betrayal is inevitable.   **Undead Nature.** An ogrepede doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

With a slow grinding sound, the statue animates and rises in the air, still seated in its onyx chair._   **Grand Sculptures.** Built to oversee great libraries, courts of law, royal houses, and the seats of government in corrupt and evil lands, onyx magistrates are intelligent constructs resembling judges, court officials, or bishops seated on massive thrones. The onyx magistrate is often placed in an area of importance such as within a great meeting hall or next to an important gate and remains motionless until it deems someone worthy of its attention or in need of punishment.   **Judge, Jury, and Executioner.** Onyx magistrates pursue their tasks with diligence and patience, never shirking from their responsibilities or showing pity or remorse for their actions. They never tolerate falsehoods or those seeking to cajole or intimidate them, though they have a soft spot for flattery, especially that which praises their abilities or dedication to their role.

  <description>This creature could be mistaken for a large centaur if not for the black and green scales covering its body and its cobra-like head. Its hiss sounds like a hundred angry vipers, and the venom dripping from creature’s long fangs sizzles as it lands._   **Born from Corruption.** An ophidiotaur is created when a centaur is transformed via a foul ritual that combines its form with that of a venomous serpent. Most centaurs do not survive the process, but those that do can reproduce naturally, potentially creating even more of these serpentine monstrosities.   **Servants of Serpents.** Ophidiotaurs serve evil nagas, Open Game License</description>

  <description>Row after row of bruise-purple fungus grows from the rocks like living shelves. The air becomes hazy as the fungus lets out a sudden puff of spores._   **Ambitious Parasite.** The ophio fungus is native to the subterranean caverns that wind through Leng, but it has no intention of remaining solely in its native world. The fungus seeks to infect as many carriers as possible to distribute itself across many planes and worlds.   **Mind Control.** The fungus attempts to infect carriers by issuing clouds of microscopic spores. Once inhaled, these spores attack the victim’s brain, sapping their willpower and eventually leaving the victim under the control of the fungus.   **Master Plan.** Once a victim is infected with ophio spores, it is entirely under the control of the fungus, connected to the parent fungus by a psychic link that even reaches across planes. The fungus uses these victims to carry pieces of itself to other places or to lure more victims into its caverns.</description>

  <description>A clumsy-looking flightless bird with a short, conical beak and no feathers or skin stares blankly with its single eye. Its organs are held in place by a slimy, transparent membrane._   **Nearly Mindless.** Orniraptors are creatures of pure instinct and share more in common with the basest vermin than with beasts. They attack anything that moves and peck off bits and pieces of their prey as they hunt, gobbling bites as it flees.   **Troublesome Pests.** Orniraptors tend to be more troublesome than dangerous, due to their persistence in striking at anything that moves. However, the creatures are capable of sharing their perceptions when near each other. This makes them particularly deadly when one notices something move and dozens of orniraptors suddenly converge on that point.   **Quiet Yet Loud.** Orniraptors have no vocal organs and simply squawk soundlessly as they go about their business. Their movements tend to be jerky and clumsy, though, and therefore quite audible.</description>

  <description>Appearing to be an unkempt human child between the ages of six and ten, this creature has bare feet and long, ragged, dirty nails. The matted mop of hair upon the creature’s head has the odd blade of grass stuck in it. Its face is gaunt, with black, expressionless eyes, and its mouth is twisted into a sneer._   **Neglectful Beginnings.** Once children of the Material Plane, these poor souls were mistreated by their guardians or people in positions of authority. Through their sadness and neglect, they inadvertently opened doorways to the Shadow Realm, and, eager for an escape from their lives, they stepped through the doorways. Over time, the atmosphere of the Shadow Realm corrupted and twisted these children into feral creatures. Orphans of the black carry no weapons or belongings, except for a single tattered blanket or broken toy.   **Problem with Authority.** Orphans of the black hate those who hold command over others. Whenever possible, creatures prominently displaying rank or other titles, along with those who issue orders. An orphan of the black may sympathize with a creature that feels belittled or neglected, and it might forgo attacking the creature to attempt to coerce the creature into becoming an orphan of the black as well.</description>

Necromancers who create ortifexes for vampiric clients pay well for a sizeable heart, especially if it is minimally decomposed.   **Agents of Oppression.** When a blood cult, necromancer, or intelligent undead wants to demoralize a village or demand a sacrifice, it often sends an ortifex to collect payment in blood.   **Undead Nature.** An ortifex doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>Brown fur covers the entire surface of this humanoid, which also has the black nose and small ears of an otter. Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._   **Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.   **Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don’t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.   **Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a Open Game License</description>

  <action>
    <name>Swallow</name>
    <text>The pal-rai-yuk makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the pal-rai-yuk, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the pal-rai-yuk’s turns. The pal-rai-yuk can have up to three Medium or smaller creatures swallowed at a time.

The swallowed creature can see outside of the pal-rai-yuk, but it can’t target those outside the pal-rai-yuk with spells or cast spells or use features that allow it to leave the pal-rai-yuk’s stomach. In addition, nothing can physically pass through the pal-rai-yuk’s stomach, preventing creatures inside the stomach from making attack rolls against creatures outside the stomach.

If the pal-rai-yuk takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the pal-rai-yuk must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the pal-rai-yuk. If the pal-rai-yuk dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

  <description>This lengthy, two-headed, serpentine creature has three dorsal fins and six legs._   **Degenerate Dragons.** Pal-rai-yuks were once a species of underwater dragons. In their arrogance, they angered a sea deity who cursed them. To escape the deity’s wrath, they adapted to tunnel through the earth, though they occasionally still seek prey in the water.   **Forgotten Meals.** By some quirk of the pal-rai-yuk’s divine transformation, creatures it swallows can see outside of its stomachs, but the creatures aren’t visible to those outside the pal-rai-yuk. Additionally, this quirk allows the serpents to erase their victims from others’ memories, leaving victims with a deep sense of isolation as they are slowly digested.   **Endlessly Hungry.** The sea god segmented their stomachs in an attempt to curb their voraciousness. Unfortunately, it made them more gluttonous. This gluttony occasionally draws the attention of powerful humanoids or large armies. When this happens, the pal-rai-yuk quickly consumes anything it can catch, then digs deep into the earth where it hibernates for years, avoiding retaliation.</description>

This is generally their first and last encounter with the pale screamer, a creature that haunts caves and waterways searching for victims to consume or transport back to the lairs of their terrible alien masters. The pale screamer pursues its mission with malicious relish and enjoys eating its prey alive, often in front of its victims’ paralyzed companions.   **Evil Blooms.** Though pale screamers are artificial creatures and do not breed naturally, their masters sometimes form them into blooms of two or more for mutual cooperation and protection. These pale screamers learn to communicate with one another by changing the coloration of their eyespots, allowing them to transmit information silently and better ambush or mislead their foes.   **Formerly Human.** Pale screamers are created by mixing human and jellyfish-like creatures together using twisted, magical surgery.

On a failed save, the mammoth enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 22 (5d8) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 22 (5d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mammoth’s turns. When the mammoth moves, engulfed creatures move with it.

  <description>This pile of rotting plant matter is shaped similarly to a woolly mammoth, without the tusks. The plants forming its hide droop to the ground._   **Elephantine Plant Mound.** The peat mammoth is a mobile peat bog on four, stumpy legs. The plants draping from it give it the shaggy appearance of a wooly mammoth. It can extrude parts of its plant mound to strike at foes, but it mostly ambles over prey, absorbing them into its mass.   **Spirit-infused.** Peat mammoths are mounds of plant material inhabited and driven by the souls of intelligent creatures that died in peat bogs. The restless spirits steer the mammoth’s movements, but the jumble of trapped souls leaves the mammoth without a true pilot or goal. Thus, the plant matter shambles onward, absorbing creatures and plants in its path, driven by the energy of spirits seeking release yet unable to find it.   **Swamp Gas Hazard.** The rotting plant and animal material contained within the peat mammoth’s mass give off flammable swamp gases. The mammoth’s saturated body gives it a measure of protection from fire, but the gases escaping from it easily catch fire. In rare instances, attacking the mammoth with fire results in a terrible explosion.</description>

Symptoms include fatigue and cramps.

  <description>These flying insects are coated in a thick layer of dust and cover the walls, ceiling and floor of a room, completely motionless in the dark. The stray light from a lantern falls one of them, awakening the swarm, which takes to the air in an angry fury._   **Awakened by Light.** The pestilence swarm is a massive group of tiny flying insects resembling enormous, fat houseflies. The smell of carrion often lures them underground or into shallow caves, though they also dig burrows. As long as they are in darkness, they are immobile, appearing almost dead. When hit by light, however, they awake and swarm any creatures in the area.   **Destroyer of Crops.** Although fortunately rare, when a cloud of these insects descends on a field, it takes mere hours for them to completely devour everything that might have been worth harvesting. They eat fruits, grains, and even the livestock, leaving a decimated field in their wake.   **Bringer of Plagues.** Pestilence swarms often carry and transmit disease as they move from area to area. They descend on populated areas, eat any food that is left out, bite the people who live there, and eventually move to the next area. Diseases from one area spread to another, festering in the bite wounds left by the swarm. The suffering they bring to small villages and towns is legendary.</description>

Its face, hands, and joints are articulated and overlapping, allowing it to move freely beneath its hardened skin. The carapace grows into spikes in numerous places throughout its body, which it uses against captured prey and to aid it in climbing.   **Highly Mobile.** Deep caverns can be difficult to navigate with their twists and tight squeezes. The phase giant overcomes this by sliding into the Ethereal Plane and passing through the solid stone.   **Familial.** Phase giants are smaller than the average hill giant, but they more than make up for it in their ferocity. They are aggressive toward others, but not actually evil, tending to view most they encounter as mere annoyances. They are usually found in small family units of up to four, but rarely band together in larger groups.</description>

  <description>A living pine tree festooned with pinecones featuring razor-sharp edges looks balefully at the intrusion upon its solitude._   **Gruff Forest Protector.** Pine dooms are typically the largest plants in their groves, towering over ordinary pine trees. They see themselves as responsible for the wellbeing of their forests. They manage the growth of trees under their protection, clear out underbrush, and kill destructive vermin, allowing their groves to prosper. They have an inborn distrust of humanoids, but if a creature entering their forests seems genuinely in trouble, pine dooms allow them to seek shelter. They retaliate strongly, however, if someone takes advantage of their charity.   **Mobile Groves.** Similar to Open Game License</description>

  <description>A Dozens of flat, purple-capped mushrooms float and spin through the air._   Huge colonies of pixie’s umbrellas inhabit the Underworld. When they sense danger, they fill their caps to gain height then release the air, using the flattened caps to slow their descent.   **Migrating Fungus.** Their ability to float allows pixie’s umbrellas to make homes on hard-to-reach surfaces, frustrating those who enjoy the mushrooms’ bitter flesh. The ground beneath wall- and cliff-dwelling pixie’s umbrellas is sometimes littered with the skeletal remains of starving travelers who fell in their desperate attempts to gather food.   **Dizzying Drifters.** Witnessing the migration of a colony of pixie’s umbrellas can be fascinating to those who enjoy watching large numbers of the mushrooms float from cavern to cavern. Intelligent Underworld hunters sometimes use the migration of pixie’s umbrellas to mask their approach, counting on the display to distract their prey.</description>

  <description>A tight, leather coif underneath a cracked, black mask that resembles a long-beaked bird with hollow, black eyes obscures the face and head of this humanoid. Long, tattered, dark-green robes drape loosely over its form. An obsidian censer decorated in etchings of dead trees moves from hand to hand, green mist pouring forth with each swing as it performs a strange and eerie dance._   Plague spirits and their deadly mists have haunted the planes as long as life has existed. The path of death left in their wake is often mistaken as the result of a natural disaster. Many druids speculate that plague spirits are entropic forces that exist as the embodiment of the darker side of nature, curbing overgrowth and allowing new life to grow from the dead.   **Harbingers of Decay.** The presence of a plague spirit is always announced by a rolling front of sickly, green mist that spans several miles. The spirit can always be found at the center, performing an unsettling yet enchanting dance. As it dances, the censer it carries expels mist in all directions. Any living thing exposed to this mist slowly succumbs to decay. Whether turning a lush forest and its inhabitants into a dark, desiccated landscape or creating a silent ruin out of a bustling city, the presence of a plague spirit forewarns a massive loss of life.   **Drawn to Life.** Plague spirits are drawn to the densest collections of life in an area, and nothing seems to deter these spirits from their path.</description>

It makes a sickening gurgling sound when it growls._   **Natives of the Swamp.** Primal oozers are amphibious natives to swamps and wetlands. They often make their lairs in the root systems of massive trees where the soil beneath has been washed away. They can also be found in flooded ruins, wet riversides, or in the water itself. They are savage, deadly, and delight in killing.   **Kinship with Mydnari.** Primal oozers have a natural kinship with Open Game License</description>

  <description>This strange dog is hairless except for the thick, dark fur that runs along its bony, ridged back._   **Arctic Legends.** Oral histories of the north are rich with tales of the qiqirn. The tales say they are drawn to mankind’s warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement’s sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.   **Afraid of Civilization.** Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.   **Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn’s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

    <text>The quickserpent turns a 10-foot cube of natural mud or loose stone into a pit of quicksand. Each creature in the area when the quickserpent creates the pit must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink 1d4 feet into the quicksand and become restrained. A creature that successfully saves moves to the pit’s edge as it is formed. A creature that enters the quicksand for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the quicksand it sinks 1d4 feet and is restrained. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can’t breathe.

A restrained creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the edge of the quicksand. A creature within 5 feet of the quicksand can take an action to pull a creature out of the quicksand. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength check, and the quickserpent has advantage on attack rolls against the creature until the end of the creature’s next turn.</text>

  <description>Muck covers this muscular snake, which seems more at home in the silt and water on the ground than among tree boughs._   **Earth Elemental Ancestry.** Formerly native to the Plane of Earth, quickserpents migrated to the Material Plane centuries ago because of a catastrophe that destroyed the area of the plane where they laired. The catastrophe also shunted the surviving serpents to swamps with connections to the Plane of   **Earth.** The creatures adapted to their new environments and lost many of their elemental traits. They still understand the language of earth elementals and typically avoid attacking the elementals. A handful of powerful elementals that remember the snakes have attempted to reintegrate them to the Plane of Earth with mixed results.   **Ambusher from Below.** A quickserpent, like many terrestrial constrictor snakes, ambushes its prey. However, it waits below the surface where it picks up the vibrations of creatures traveling above it. If the terrain is suitable, the serpent churns the ground into quicksand to pull unsuspecting prey into the earth. While its victim struggles to escape the mire, the serpent takes advantage of its prey’s helplessness to wrap itself around and crush its prey. If the serpent manages to ensnare more than one creature, it targets the one with the most success emerging from the quicksand.</description>

  <description>Vaguely humanoid in appearance, this creature has long, raking claws, a jerking gait, and no facial features. Its mushroom-gray skin is covered in strange bumps and eddies as if something were seething just below the surface._   **Faceless Nightmares.** Dwelling on the fringes of human society in abandoned buildings, polluted thickets, and grimy backstreets, the quoreq is an aberration born from human misery and squalor, an agglomeration of negative and vile thoughts given form and motion. Though not especially picky in their choice of victims, they are empathetically drawn to creatures experiencing some form of despair or pain.   **Emotionless Killers.** Quoreqs do not experience emotions the same way most humanoids do and have no concept of fear or love. They do not inflict pain for simple enjoyment, instead inflicting it to share in the experience such intense emotions can produce. As they inflict pain, they often telepathically ask their victims how it feels.   **Horrible Feeding.** Quoreqs eat and sleep like any normal creature, but, since their mouths are concealed beneath their rigid flesh, they must use their claws to rip open their own bodies to quickly gulp down food before they can regenerate. This unusual and horrific practice lends some support to the theory that quoreqs are wholly unnatural creatures born directly from human nightmares.</description>

  <description>A large cloud composed of tiny glowing sparks of fire floats silently through the air._   **Origin of Planar Instability.** Radiant spark swarms form when the border lands between the Plane of Fire and the Upper Planes experience some sort of instability. This instability might be caused by a regional anomaly, war between the gods themselves, magical upheaval, or some other calamity. Thousands of radiant sparks are created at once in massive conflagrations of radiant energy. They are then left to wander the planes alone. These creatures are most often found in the border lands between planes, but they have been known to appear in the Material Plane after accessing it through magical portals. They seldom wander back to their planes of origin and are almost always destroyed at some point during their eternal wanderings.   **Hunger for Magic.** Radiant spark swarms are drawn to magic for reasons that aren’t fully understood, for they can neither use it, nor do they truly devour it. Instead, when they sense powerful magic nearby, they instinctually move toward it, as though its very presence is comforting to them. As creatures that are neither particularly intelligent nor evil, their interest in the living usually has to do with the magic spellcasters carry, which draws the sparks close. Unfortunately, the owner of the magic that drew them is often caught in the midst of the swarm, which is inherently harmful.   **Elemental Nature.** A radiant spark swarm doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A mechanical whir issues from this pyramid-shaped mechanism as it begins to unfold hundreds of jointed limbs. When the noise grows shrillest, alien runes alight across its golden surfaces._   **Secret Keepers.** The people of Leng are renowned traders, and it once occurred to a Leng inventor that knowledge is the most valuable trade good. That inventor’s identity is one of the many secrets the first repository faithfully keeps. These constructs are built for the reception, transmission, and safeguarding of information, and even those that don’t hold particularly coveted information still defend their charges with lethal force. Repositories sometimes hold secrets within their consciousness, a task made easier by the fact that these creatures can understand all languages. Others hold physical recordings of information within their chest cavities.   **Master of Language.** A repository exists to protect and trade information, and as such, it knows and can translate all languages. Its programming allows it to wield this mastery of language as a physical weapon. A repository can also use the power of language as a psychic assault, uttering words of power to attack the very minds of its enemies.   **Right Tool for the Job.** The chest cavity of a repository contains an extradimensional space that functions like a bag of holding, granting the repository the ability to pull out any tool that may be required. Most repositories keep sets of common tools stashed inside their chests, including thieves’ tools and smith’s tools. Some repositories, however, are equipped with specialized tools or magic items, depending on the creatures’ purpose at creation. Similarly, a repository can store anything it needs to protect in this extra-dimensional space. The repository is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive. When a repository is destroyed, its chest cavity becomes accessible to anyone that reaches inside its pyramidal form; however, the power holding this extra-dimensional space together fades after 1 hour. An object in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is destroyed. A creature in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.   **Construct Nature.** A repository doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

The constructs are placed as guards where great evil is housed to prevent anyone from accessing and awakening that which lies within.   **Abhors Violence.** Righteous sentinels seek to avoid violence as much as possible, but they react with unbridled rage when their ward is disturbed. When intruders disturb the objects of great evil the sentinels are protecting, the sentinel turns its reflective shield toward an intruder. The shield reflects a vision of that creature’s soul back toward it, which is often enough to horrify even the most evil of monsters.   **Construct Nature.** The righteous sentinel does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The insect clings to a large rock and drips saliva on it. A puff of steam rises from the rock, and the creature licks at the liquid remains, leaving a pockmark in the stone._   **Rock Eaters.** The rock roach is a giant cousin to the roach, and it feeds on rocks deep beneath the ground. It uses its proboscis to deposit acidic saliva onto the rock, breaking it down and lapping up the liquefied minerals. A rock roach’s metabolism is slow to match its tedious eating process. Even still, a group of rock roaches can make quick work of a rocky wall, opening up routes between caverns. The roaches aren’t concerned for structural integrity and their eating habits, if left unimpeded, often lead to cave-ins.   **Naturally Hostile.** Rock roaches are instinctually hostile to anything that wanders near them, including each other. The roaches mate annually, and the parents abandon the eggs shortly after laying them. Young rock roaches band together for the first few months of life, protecting each other as they devour the rock where they hatched, then dispersing once they are large enough to defend themselves.   **Valuable Carapace.** The carapace of a rock roach is sought after by some groups of underground humanoids. Naturally resilient and hard, craftsman harvest the carapace and slowly sculpt it into a suit of armor in a month-long process that requires regular boiling of the tough carapace.</description>

  <description>This huge, six-horned, bull-like creature possesses a mane of writhing flames and shimmering metal skin._   **Creation of the Gods.** All sarsaok descend from a mighty celestial ox said to have been present at the creation of humanity. Scholars speculate the union of domestic or wild oxen produced the first sarsaok.   **Inhospitable Habitats.** The sarsaok dwell in areas of great heat and fire such as Volcanoes or other geologically active regions. In addition to consuming flora, they are known to drink liquid magma and graze on obsidian, pumice, or other volcanic rock.   **Peaceful Horror.** Though of great size and strength, sarsaoks are peaceful herbivores similar in demeanor to wild oxen. When threatened, an entire herd attacks until the threat has ended.</description>

  <description>A golden pair of glowing, avian irises reveal a large creature on a nearby tree. Horn-like feathered ears sit atop its muscular, winged form. As it shifts on its branch, its wings divulge a hint of insectoid claws beneath them. A soft, echoing voice asks, “Are you lost? Do you need aid?”_   Sasori fukurōwashi are kami originating from reincarnated noble souls who consistently honored and protected nature in their past life.   **Friendly Protectors.** Unlike others of their kind, these kami are not found near specific shrines, and they can’t be summoned. The sasori fukurōwashi are divine spirits inherently connected to all of nature, fulfilling the role of divine agent, messenger, or roaming protector. They are generally peaceable, befriending non-evil humanoids, fey, and other magical beings that don’t defile natural environments.   **Nocturnal.** They are inclined to rest or meditate by day and are active from dusk until dawn. Blessed with the ability to shift to and from the Ethereal Plane, these kami have a distinct tactical advantage to aid any nearby kami or respectful and contrite travelers along their way.   **Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>A tall, ape-like creature walks upright, its arms ending in heavy fists. The creature’s lips curl back, revealing long, pointed teeth set in a powerful jaw._   Sasquatches are large beasts that stalk deep forests and other densely wooded areas. They are bipedal primates that stand about nine feet tall and are covered in black, brown, or red fur.   **Famously Elusive.** Many people claim to have seen a sasquatch, but almost none have proof of their interaction with the beast, creating questions about the creature’s existence. Skeptics claim sasquatch sightings are simply misidentified bears, apes, or similar creatures. Many sages and hunters journey deep into forests, hoping to find proof sasquatches exist and returning only with a handful of fur that could belong to almost any animal. In truth sasquatches are solitary nocturnal creatures that generally avoid confrontation. They prefer to stay in the shadows of the forest, dining on vegetation and insects while staying clear of other creatures.   **Hidden Lairs.** Sasquatches are smart enough to hide the entrances to their lairs with heavy boulders, underbrush, fallen trees, a waterfall, or some other obstruction that appears to be a natural part of the terrain. They hide gathered food and shiny trinkets they find in the forest in these cozy homes, where they rest during daylight hours.   **Aggressive When Provoked.** Though sasquatches prefer to avoid confrontation, they fight savagely when cornered or if another creature threatens their home or food source. Their powerful fists and teeth make formidable weapons. Sasquatches do not hesitate to initiate a conflict when threatened.   **Attracted and Soothed by Music.** There are some who claim sasquatches are drawn and calmed by music, particularly songs with a lullaby-like quality. These tales come with a warning: stopping the song before the sasquatch is lulled to sleep by its melody causes the beast to go into a violent rage.</description>

  <description>This gigantic marsh bird has blood-red feathers and a scythe-like beak. Its eyes shine with intelligence as it scans its surroundings._   **Accursed Bird.** Scarlet ibises are not inherently malevolent, and many visitors to the swamp assume they are natural, if overly large, birds. However, their beaks bestow unluck on those touched or struck by them. The ibises usually reserve their cursed attacks as retribution for themselves, but swamp dwellers sometimes plea for the birds’ intercession on those who have wronged them. Scarlet ibises have keen judgment to determine the worthiness of these requests. Those who know about scarlet ibises and their terrible curses avoid killing the birds and typically warn others about the consequences of killing them. Less scrupulous folk instead encourage naïve travelers to destroy a scarlet ibis then pick off the travelers suffering from the aftereffects of combat with the birds.   **Dream Portent.** The scarlet ibis is a symbol of ill omens that appears in dreams. This omen precedes a setback—such as inclement weather, a tremor, the group getting lost, or a lame mount or pack animal—but it can also indicate a doomed mission. After a series of unfortunate incidents, the scarlet ibis makes a physical appearance, signifying the bad luck has ended. This sometimes incites the unfortunates to avenge themselves on the bird under the mistaken belief the ibis is the cause of the problems.   **Egret Harpy Friends.** Scarlet ibises congregate with Open Game License</description>

  <description>This upright, muscular boar has short, brown fur. Though it stands on cloven hooves, its arms end in oversized fists._   **Seeker of Champions.** The scrofin is a powerfully built creature that seeks to find a worthy challenger for a wrestling challenge. A winner is declared when one creature holds its opponent in a grapple for 30 seconds. The scrofin is aware its natural gifts make it a formidable foe and feels duty-bound to make others aware of its advantages. An honorable battle is its highest goal, and it ensures that no great harm comes to its opponent during the contest, immediately relenting if its opponent submits.   **Short Tempered.** If the scrofin feels its opponent is fighting dishonorably or if something unrelated to the wrestling match harms it (a cast spell, a hidden weapon, or similar), it goes berserk at the betrayal. In normal combat situations, it loses its temper when it takes too many injuries. The scrofin can calm itself but only chooses to when it believes its opponents are truly contrite about breaking its trust or harming it.   **Outcast from the Courts.** The scrofins’ sense of honor is at odds with many of their fellow fey, regardless of court, who believe exploiting any advantage in a situation is acceptable. This coupled with what the fey see as the scrofins’ tiresome insistence on proving their physical superiority makes them unwelcome in many fey courts. For their part, scrofins are content to walk the mortal world in search of champions.</description>

  <description>The grinning ghoul’s mace drips with shadow as it chants prayers to its dark god. Another shadowy grin appears on top of the ghoul’s and extends out, consuming all it touches._   **Worshiper of Hunger.** The Unsated God, is a god of death, hunger, and the undead. The bulk of his followers, especially in the deep caverns of the world, are undead. The most common of these followers are darakhul— intelligent and civilized ghouls—who share their lord’s unholy hunger. The servants of the Unsated God act as civil officials, support the imperial army, and spread the faith (often by slaying intruding surface dwellers then recruiting them as newly risen undead).   **Hungry Dead Nature.** The ghoul requires no air or sleep.</description>

He followed the shadow as it moved along the wall then transferred to the ground, not noticing the distortion of light behind him. The last thing he heard as the invisible feline tore out his throat was a contented purr._   **Finicky Spirits.** Shadow boxers are the physical manifestation of feline collective memory. They are found in urban areas and other places people congregate. Like other fey, they desire to be placated by mortals, and they allow their presence to be detected to induce people to leave them gifts. A shadow boxer develops relationships with one household at a time and protects it. Households that don’t leave sufficient tribute or that cease offering it gifts entirely swiftly find their members targeted by the slighted fey.   **Council of Cats.** When they sleep, shadow boxers share dreams with all mundane cats and other shadow boxers within a mile. Within the dream, the cats and the shadow boxer gambol and roughhouse while they share information. Many capers and activities are planned during these dream sessions, and seeing a large clowder of cats getting along is a sign that a shadow boxer in the area has a game afoot. Shadow boxers despise creatures, such as Open Game License</description>

  <description>The plain, white mushroom suddenly shifts and twists into a poisonous deathcap._   In their natural form, shiftshrooms are white mushrooms with bifurcated stalks. Their natural ability to disguise themselves as other mushrooms evolved as a defense against creatures harvesting them for food.   _**Sought for Food.**_ Roasted shiftshroom has a nutty flavor and aroma and is considered a delicacy by many of the Underworld’s denizens. Discerning surface world gourmands pay respectable sums for shiftshroom caps due to the difficulty in harvesting them from the Underworld and the difficulty in growing them above ground.   _**Hidden in View.**_ Shiftshrooms can often be found interspersed with deadlier fungi. The Underworld hides colonies of the fungus wherein only a few of the mushrooms toward the outer edges of the group are dangerous varieties of fungus, and the remainder are disguised shiftshrooms.</description>

  <description>This tusked seal is nearly transparent, including its internal organs, except for a few spots dotting its hide._   **Unseen Pinnipeds.** Shimmer seals traverse their typical habitats hidden from prey and predators alike. Their translucent skin and internal organs allow them to blend in with water and against icy backgrounds. Against other backgrounds, they leave a telltale shimmer, giving them their name. However, the seals can still take the unwary by surprise in less-than-ideal conditions. The only time the seal fully loses it translucency is when it consumes its diet of fish or small mammals, during which observers receive a breathtaking (or nauseating) view of the seals’ digestive process. The seals are aware of this vulnerability and usually feast in hidden locations. Arctic druids and rangers who successfully befriend shimmer seals use them as spies or as an advance wave of attack.   **Guardian of Seals.** Though shimmer seals notionally look like harbor seals, they are found among many different species of seal. Scholars who have studied the strange seals concluded shimmer seals are created when the spirits of creatures passionate about protecting overhunted animals merge with those of ordinary seals. When a shimmer seal dies protecting a pod of seals from hunters, one of the seals transforms into a new shimmer seal within a minute of the other shimmer seal’s death, reinforcing this theory. While shimmer seals are vigilant against hunting by humanoids, they allow natural predators to cull the seals under their protection, understanding the natural order and its importance.   **Rallying Seal.** A shimmer seal allows other seals to see it, and it can allow allied creatures to locate it. The presence of a shimmer seal emboldens the seals under its protection, transforming a pod of seals that might scatter in the face of armed opposition into an army of teeth and flippers, with the shimmer seal leading the counterattack. No one knows if the shimmer seal is aware of its ability to reincarnate shortly after it dies, but its fearlessness points to it possessing a certainty of survival.</description>

  <description>This midnight-blue bat has a cavern-filling wingspan. The air near its mouth, large enough to carry a horse, visibly vibrates with sound pulses._   Shriekbats thrive in the cavernous spaces of the Underworld where they face little competition from dragons, rocs, and other large flying creatures, as they would aboveground. Despite their enormousness, the bats deftly maneuver among the stalactites and stalagmites crowding underground caverns. When they attack prey, or in the very rare cases where they must escape predators, they emit a terrible shriek that overwhelms their foes and allows them to easily grab prey or escape. Shriekbat echolocation uses subsonic frequencies, allowing the bats to fly in relative silence.   **Kobold Companions.** Kobold bat keepers know the secret to raising young shriekbats. The bat keepers often risk their lives to procure young, using the bats for protection and as companions. A bat keeper returns its shriekbat to the wild before the bat reaches adulthood, when it would become too large for the cramped kobold tunnels. A bat keeper tracks the shriekbats it releases, and often returns to visit its former companions. Shriekbats prove surprisingly keen at remembering former kobold handlers (whether such handlers treated them well or poorly), and they often allow fondly remembered handlers to take a single pup from their litters, ensuring the pup survives to adulthood and renewing the cycle.   **Long-Lived Omnivores.** Shriekbats live for nearly 50 years. They are social and promiscuous creatures that live in small groups in large caverns. They are omnivorous but prefer fresh meat to other food with lizards taking up the majority of their diet. Shriekbats can survive on rotten flesh, which allows them to eat ghouls and other undead populating the Underworld, but they find it less palatable. In overcrowded situations where multiple groups of shriekbats roost in the same cavern, a group of shriekbats might break away to find another hunting location if food becomes scarce.</description>

    <text>The shukankor magically duplicates itself, creating four replicas. Each replica uses the statistics of an axe beak, except it also has the shukankor’s Many Eyes and Self-made Pack traits. The shukankor can communicate telepathically with a replica as long as they are within 120 feet of each other. The replicas act as allies of the shukankor and obey its telepathic commands. The replicas remain until killed or dismissed by the shukankor as a bonus action. Slain or dismissed replicas melt into a foul-smelling puddle of green goo. A replica that survives for 24 hours breaks its telepathic link with the shukankor, becoming a free-thinking creature, and grows into a full shukankor after 1 month.</text>

  <description>This creature has gaudy green and purple feathers, stunted humanoid limbs, a cruel, vulture-like beak, and multiple eyes that swivel about on long, lime-colored stalks. It hoots diabolically as it approaches._   **Wasteland Hunters.** Desolate badlands, deserts, and wastelands warped by foul sorcery are the prime feeding grounds for these colorful aberrations, who use their vicious claws and beaks to kill and devour any creature they encounter. Due to their enormous size, they sometimes resort to eating rotting and undead flesh, and they can even eat rocks, plants, and dirt in a pinch. Because they are intelligent monsters, shukankors can be parlayed with, though their demands are usually extravagant and vile.   **Strength in Numbers.** The shukankor’s ability to temporarily replicate itself aids it greatly in battle, especially when it is outnumbered or facing a particularly powerful opponent. These replicas are smaller, weaker clones of the shukankor that obey its telepathic commands and even sacrifice themselves to protect their creator. Shukankors are neither female nor male and reproduce by allowing their replicas to remain alive. After a day, these replicas become free-thinking and separate from the parent shukankor. A month later, they grow into full-sized shukankors with all the powers of their progenitor.</description>

    <text>The shurale’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

  <action>
    <name>Tickle</name>
    <text>The shurale touches a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving or begin to laugh uncontrollably for 1 minute. While laughing, the target falls prone, is incapacitated, and unable to move. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shurale’s Tickle for the next 24 hours. If the target fails the saving throw three times, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hp and begin dying. On a success, the laughter ends on the target, as normal.</text>
  </action>
  <description>At first glance this creature resembles a satyr, its lower body covered in brown fur with goat-like hooves, yet the twisted horn sprouting from its forehead and the wide, manic grin on its comical face proves it is something far more dangerous._   **Devilish Fey.** While many fey are evil and twisted creatures, few are worse than the dreaded shurale, a deadly satyr-like monster that causes horrible hilarity with its ticklish touch. It inflicts a victim with a deadly bout of laughter that causes its internal organs to rupture and fail. After the victim dies, the shurale cuts it into pieces, leaving the remains for the scavengers.   **Feeds on Laughter.** A shurale feeds on the sobbing laughs of its victims as they expire, its own health mysteriously revitalized in the process. Because of this, shurale lairs are typically located within a few miles of a humanoid settlement, where it can easily lure lone inhabitants into the woods. While most of their prey are humanoids living in alpine or heavily forested regions, shurales are not picky and have been known to attack orcs, ogres, trolls, and even hill giants.   **Woodcutter’s Curse.** Many believe that a shurale is the spirit of a woodcutter who died a lonely and embittered death after being ridiculed by family. While such an occurrence would be exceedingly rare and most sages scoff at such suggestions, the shurale’s skill with the woodcutter’s axe and its strange behavior cannot be denied.</description>

  </action>
  <description>The halfling takes a long drink from a mug, its wild, graying hair falling back to reveal the creature’s pointed nose and sharp chin. Its bloodshot eyes hold a glimmer of mischief as it sets down the mug._   **Tavern Spirits.** Sileni adopt a specific tavern or inn as their own. The presence of a silenal is usually discovered slowly by the owner. Perhaps they notice the bar towels have all been mended or that the empty bottles have been placed outside the back door. If the owner accepts this assistance and leaves small gifts of food and drink, the silenal becomes more active. After hours, the silenal spends its time ensuring the establishment is cleaned to a shine and ready for the next day’s business. If the owner and the silenal are at odds, however, the small mischiefs and mishaps caused by the silenal quickly drive the owner out of business.   **Flawed Advisors.** While the business is open, a silenal spends most of its time drinking and conversing with the patrons. Sileni are curious about mortals and find their tales and troubles fascinating. If a creature conversing with a silenal asks it for advice, the counsel received is invariably flawed. The silenal, interested in hearing more dramatic tales, offers guidance which is guaranteed to get its conversation partner in hot water in the hopes the recipient will return to lament new, entertaining troubles.   **Calm in the Storm.** Regardless of how chaotic activity gets in its bar, the silenal is strangely unaffected. Tavern brawls, whether caused by the silenal or not, never target it. The damage caused by fights is also reduced and rarely results in more than a few broken chairs and tankards.</description>

    <name>One Hundred Mage Hands</name>
    <text>The snake is surrounded by one hundred, magical, spectral hands. The hands can’t be targeted by spells or attacks and are immune to damage. The hands float within 30 feet of the snake and move with their serpent commander. The snake can decide if the hands are visible. Each hand can carry an object weighing up to 10 pounds and no more than three hands can work in tandem to carry one larger object. The snake’s Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks have a range of 30 feet. Whenever the snake makes a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, it can make up to four such checks as part of the same action, but each check must be against a different target. The snake can perform actions normally restricted to creatures with hands, such as opening a door, stirring a bowl of soup, or carrying a lantern. The hands can’t wield weapons or shields or make attacks, except as part of the snake’s Flying Fists action.</text>

  <description>The small snake slithers forward. As it nears a door, spectral hands appear all around it, opening and pushing the door to allow the snake entry._   **Pet Project.** Thieves’ guilds with magically inclined members often imbue particularly crafty snakes with keen intelligence, telepathy, and the ability to summon dozens of mage hands to aid the guild. The small, stealthy creatures are capable of carrying out heists that are logistically impractical for humanoids due to their bulk. Predictably, the clever reptiles often escape their creators and carve out small territories for themselves in the more disreputable parts of cities where their true identities won’t easily be discovered.   **Mischievous Thieves.** Snakes with a hundred mage hands are known for their mischievous nature. Many are kleptomaniacs and swindlers, using their talents to deceive humanoids and steal objects they find pleasing.</description>

If the snow terror takes 15 or more damage on a single turn from the swallowed creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the snow terror.

  <description>A sizeable snowperson with sticks for arms, a carrot nose, and a smile etched across its face slowly turns its head. Closer inspection reveals the smile is disturbingly jagged._   **Demonic Snow People.** Snow terrors hail from an icy layer of the Abyss. There, they torment lesser fiends or watch as wind-whipped snow destroys visitors wholly unprepared for it. Such visitors are few and far between, leading snow terrors to travel to the Material Plane for greater chances at entertainment.   **Innocuous Disguise.** Snow terrors temper their desire for bloodshed and mayhem with patience. They find heavily trafficked areas and lurk nearby, observing potential prey. When choosing victims, they remain motionless in their guise as ordinary snowpersons, even allowing children to pluck the accoutrements off them.   **Sadistic Hunter.** A snow terror picks off lone people first, reveling in communities consequently thrown into chaos. Just before it attacks, it reveals its true form: a leering, shark-toothed snowperson with unholy light glowing in its eye sockets. It chases, catches, and devours its victims, relishing the screams as the acid churning in its guts slowly dissolves its prey. It can take on the appearance of its victims, drawing in concerned family members and neighbors before dissolving the facade to attack.</description>

  <description>A gray-skinned human steps from the shadows. Dripping mandibles emerge from its too-wide mouth, and six lithe and long arms unfold from beneath its robes to grasp its prey in vicious claws._   **Bridging the Veil.** The somberweave is a spider-like fey creature that relies on the fragile threads separating the   **Material Plane from the Shadow Realm.** Spanning the gap between the two planes, it weaves a web anchored in both worlds. It hides in the section of its web anchored in the Shadow Realm and waits for victims on the Material Plane. If plied with treasure or food, the somberweave can be convinced to offer travelers in one realm access to the other, but it is just as likely to capture and eat such travelers.   **Tenebrous Skein.** The web of the somberweave is made of pure darkness, the essence of the Shadow Realm. Clever travelers who defeat a somberweave can follow the remnants of its web to find passage into or out of the Shadow Realm. Shadow fey who travel frequently between the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane prize somberweave webs as the primary material for creating items that allow for easier travel between the planes.</description>

Its body is thin and sinewy, and its skin is a sickly green._   **Demonic Servants.** These demons lurk in darkness, serving and protecting Alquam, the Demon Lord of Night. Alquam is known to send them to aid his cults, and he sometimes utilizes them to assassinate individuals who threaten his followers. Because the spawn are created by Alquam, many of his cults worship them as physical representations of the Demon Lord himself. The cults believe that offerings to the spawn are conveyed directly to their master in his planar abode.   **Kinship with Shadow.** When the spawn of Alquam venture to the Material Plane, they take care to move only in places that are cloaked in darkness. While direct light does not harm them, they find it uncomfortable and often flee from it.   **Lords of Birds.** Birds instinctively follow the mental commands of the spawn of Alquam, and sudden changes in bird behavior that can signal a spawn is nearby. Swarms of birds attack targets the spawn designates, act as the spawn’s messengers, and enact the spawn’s or Alquam’s will in whatever way either demon dictates.</description>

They serve as his direct agents, whether he is trying to establish alliances or going to war against some individual or group.   _**Lords of Butterflies and Moths.**_ Like the demon lord himself, the spawn of Rhopalocerex enjoy a special kinship with moths and butterflies. Moths and butterflies regularly accompany the spawn, aiding them whenever possible.   **Wardens of the Abyss.** The spawn of Rhopalocerex are the wardens of the deadly wild areas of the Abyss under Rhopalocerex’s control, defending it against all who would come to defile it. They originate at the demon lord’s lair in the great tree and fly beneath its wide boughs, looking for threats or awaiting missions to other planes.</description>

  </action>
  <description>A shimmering coat and a ridged snout distinguish the hound from other monstrous canines._   **Vindictive Origins.** The first spellhounds began as nothing more than ordinary scent hounds. When the master of the hounds was tormented by a hag, he struck a deal with a powerful fey lord, requesting that his stock be blessed with the ability to hunt the witch. The hounds were returned to him, empowered and mutated, but capable of making short work of the hag nonetheless. After the houndmaster was ostracized for keeping monstrous pets, he grew resentful and concluded that the fey lord had wronged him. He arrogantly set out with his spellhounds after the fey lord that had created them, but he never returned. Ever since, spellhounds have been kept as prized pets by warring fey or set loose in fey-inhabited forests to prey on lonely spellcasters.   **Magical Predators.** Spellhounds have olfactory capabilities that allow them to sense the “odor” of spellcasters. This, combined with their spell-repelling coats and their magic-disrupting howls, makes them a menace for anyone with even a minor arcane faculty.</description>

  <description>The spurred water skate is a diurnal carnivore. It has weak mandibles, but the adaptations enabling it to move on the water make it a powerful hunter. The distribution of the spurred water skate’s weight, along with leg bristles that create and hold air bubbles at the surface, allow it to stand on top of even moderately choppy water and move without sinking. The insect’s sharp forelimbs are powerful enough to kill weaker prey outright, but it prefers to use its limbs to grasp targets and submerge them until they drown. Because spurred water skates move effortlessly across wet surfaces, they are desirable mounts in the swamps and marshes they inhabit. Open Game License</description>

  <description>This bipedal reptilian creature has scales of gold that turn to red in the shadow. It has clawed hands but wields a sword. Its breath smells of brimstone, and a hint of smoke can be seen escaping through its nostrils._   **Jungle Dwellers.** The ssadar dwell in the jungle and rarely travel to other climates. They prefer the heat, the moisture, and the cover provided by the jungle foliage, though they are capable of surviving in the desert. They live in small cities, usually at the base of mountains near abundant water sources, and they closely monitor the surrounding regions to make sure that non-ssadar are not attempting to approach. Those who make their way toward—or, more rarely, into—their cities are attacked. If captured, intruders are usually sacrificed to their evil lizard gods.   **Pyramid Builders.** The ssadar are builders of terraced pyramids with engravings of dragons and their lizard gods. These are temples where they congregate, worship, and perform ritual sacrifices. Most of their cities are built around these magnificent structures, though abandoned pyramids can also be found in the trackless depths of the jungle. The entrance to these structures is at the top, and each of them contains a multi-level labyrinth of chambers inside.</description>

    <name>Mouth Compartment</name>
    <text>The stellar rorqual’s mouth is a compartment that is 60 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 30 feet high with a single entry and exit. The rorqual can control the ambient pressure, temperature, gravity, moisture, and breathable air levels inside its mouth, allowing creatures and objects within it to exist comfortably in spite of conditions outside the rorqual. Creatures and objects within the rorqual have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rorqual. As an action, a creature inside the rorqual can interact with the crystalline growths inside the rorqual’s mouth and sense what the rorqual senses, gaining the benefits of its blindsight.</text>

  <description>This massive cetacean swims through the Void while crackling lines of energy race between the crystal formations on its body and massive, feather-like flippers._   **Born in the Void.** Stellar rorqual are born, live, and die in the depths of the space between the stars. Generally peaceful creatures, they live to impossibly old age, singing their ancient songs to each other across immense distances.   **Living Starships.** Those lucky or skilled enough can use a stellar rorqual as a living ship to provide passage between planes. This partnership can be based on friendship or domination, depending on the method of training.   Communication with the rorqual is mostly telepathic, and the crystalline growths on the inside of its jaws display what the rorqual sees. Though a stellar rorqual finds it uncomfortable, it can enter the Material Plane from the Void to load or disembark passengers. When this occurs, the rorqual lands in an available ocean, if possible.   **Solar Feeders.** The stellar rorqual does not need to eat and seldom opens its actual mouth. As it travels the Void, it absorbs solar energy from stars, which forms crystalline growths on the rorqual’s body. The growths slowly release the energy into the rorqual, providing it with the only form of sustenance it needs.   **Void Traveler.** The stellar rorqual doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.</description>

  <description>This plant looks like a cluster of vines with elongated tendrils and leaves. A clear fluid drips from its thorns and spatters on the floor around it._   **Feed on Stone.** Stone creepers are semi-intelligent plants that feed on the mortar that holds structures together. They are commonly found in abandoned castles, ruins, and underground locations where the tunnels and chambers were reinforced with stone or brick. The stone creepers secrete acid into the mortar holding the building materials together, breaking it down quickly for easy consumption.   **Living Traps.** Stone creepers are typically found deeply enmeshed within stone or bricks and hidden in walls. Most creatures that initially see them assume they are ordinary vines. If there is a threat below them, they hastily withdraw from their position, dislodging the bricks or rocks that fall down upon the intruders.   **Semi-Social.** Stone creepers tend to live in groups of three to five. Often, they nearly encompass an entire room and feed upon it, waiting for hapless victims to enter a room. After they have consumed all the mortar and caused a collapse, they move on to new areas where they begin the process again.</description>

  <description>At the heart of a violent storm, a young woman lies huddled in despair. Her skin is translucent as if made of water, and her tears float up from her face to join the storm above her._   A storm maiden is a spiteful elemental that pulls powerful storms into the world through a portal connected to her shrine. Blinded by anguish, she seeks to erase any trace of those who betrayed her.   **Primordial Sacrifice.** Long ago, this woman was offered up to powerful spirits to ward off drought and famine. She served her role faithfully. Her shrine was maintained by a ritual of devotion performed by the descendants of those she loved, but it was eventually abandoned. Now, some transgression against her abandoned shrine has drawn the maiden back to the world.   **Abating the Storm.** A region plagued by a storm maiden experiences regular flooding and random tornadoes and lightning strikes. A community may yet atone for their ancestral betrayal by performing a long-forgotten ritual at the maiden’s shrine. If appeased, the storms end, and the maiden’s alignment changes from evil to good. An appeased maiden may go on to protect the region for generations, as long as her shrine is maintained, or she might wander to other regions, seeking communities in need who understand the importance of maintaining her shrine.   **Elemental Nature.** A storm maiden doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

The explosion created a horrific storm that raged for days in the region, causing the locals to take shelter. When the storm dissipated, the wizard and their tower were gone, but the hogs had been transformed into scaled beasts that harnessed the power of lightning and thunder.   **Storm’s Fury.** Stormboars embody the fury of the storm. Just as stubborn and ferocious as their more mundane cousins, stormboars let no obstacle get in their way while they look for food or protect their offspring. Seasoned hunters know to drop an offering of metal behind as they leave the area to ensure the boar is too distracted to follow them.   **Metal Devourers.** Stormboars crave metal. Prospectors track the boars to find areas rich with precious minerals and ore, and treasure hunters use the creatures to sniff out hidden vaults of wealth. Anyone relying on a stormboar must be careful, however. The boars see any creature wearing or carrying metal as the deliverer of an easy meal. The aggressive creatures won’t stop attacking until they’ve consumed every bit of metal an unfortunate traveler is carrying. Starving stormboars have been known to venture into civilized areas for a meal.</description>

    <name>Strobe</name>
    <text>As a bonus action, the strobing fungus can start emitting a powerful, strobing light. It rapidly alternates between shedding bright light in a 60-foot radius and shedding no light, creating a dizzying effect unless the area’s ambient light is bright light. Each creature within 60 feet of the strobing fungus and that can see the light must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Unless surprised, a creature with a shield or other similarly-sized object can use its reaction to raise the object and protect its eyes from the light, avoiding the saving throw. If it does so, it can’t use that object for anything else. For example, a creature using a shield to protect its eyes loses the shield’s bonus to its Armor Class while using the shield in this way. If the creature looks at the strobing fungus or lowers or uses the object protecting its eyes, it must immediately make the save.

While emitting light, the strobing fungus can’t attack. It can stop emitting light at any time (no action required).</text>

  <description>This creature is translucent with a white core and is composed of a narrow stalk topped with a bulbous head. It suddenly emits a powerfully bright light, then flashes bright and dark in rapid succession._   **Chemical Warrior.** The strobing fungus’ body houses chemicals that, when mixed together, cause it to shine brighter than a torch. It also uses those chemicals for self-defense. When it senses danger, it mixes the chemicals inside a pouch within its body and secretes the mixture, which it can then shoot at the creature threatening it. Once exposed to the open air, the chemicals become highly corrosive and toxic.   **Wandering Mushroom.** Unlike many fungi, the strobing fungus is able to move, albeit at a slow pace. It does this by severing the portion of its base anchoring it in place and secreting some of the chemicals within its body to help it glide along to a new location. When it has reached its intended destination, it stops secreting the chemical, its movement stops, and the creature quickly attaches to the ground at the new location.   **Popular Guards.** Strobing fungi are often employed as guardians, particularly by creatures that have blindsight. The fungi understand rudimentary Common and can obey commands not to attack their master’s allies. They typically assume anyone who has not been specifically introduced to them is an enemy and behave accordingly.</description>

    <name>Fake Feast</name>
    <text>The swamp lily magically creates the image of a banquet within 5 feet of itself that compels creatures to eat from it. Each creature within 60 feet of the banquet that can see the banquet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lily. The lily must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to maintain the illusion. The illusion ends if the lily is incapacitated.

While charmed by the lily, a target is incapacitated and ignores the banquets of other lilies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the lily’s banquet, the target must move on its turn toward the banquet by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the lily, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this swamp lily’s Fake Feast for the next 24 hours.

If the charmed target starts its turn within 5 feet of the banquet, it eats the feast and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.</text>

  <description>This large, delicate, orange flower stands guard over a sumptuous banquet laid out near its roots._   **Deceivingly Delectable.** Swamp lilies are carnivorous plants that thrive on the rotting remains of creatures they poison. While they can envenom victims with their tentacle-like roots, they prefer to lure in prey with an illusion of a seemingly benign feast. The lilies exude a scent of fruit with the musk from prey animals to complement the illusion. Their victims then peaceably eat the food, unwittingly ingesting the lily’s roots and deadly toxin.   **Wandering Menace.** After killing enough prey to keep it well fed and provide nourishment for its seeds, it travels where it can sense creatures with a strong desire for food. Though the plant does not understand the dynamics of food supply, its ability to understand thoughts pertaining to food allows it to relocate where the inhabitants are desperate and more susceptible to its illusory feast.   **Grove Guardians.** Druids and creatures respectful of poisonous plants or resistant to the swamp lilies’ illusions often establish a rapport with the lilies as protectors. Partners to the lilies give additional credence to the illusions produced by the plants and encourage unwanted guests to partake of the nonexistent food.</description>

Mosquitos, gnats, and other flying insects form a cloud around it._   **Self-Proclaimed Ruler and Protector.** The swamp naga is a manifestation of the swamp it inhabits. Its physical form is reminiscent of snakes, and marsh plants grow from its head. The naga’s strong tie to the swamp provides an impetus to protect its home and to believe it is the swamp’s sovereign. Because of this strong link, a swamp rarely hosts more than one naga, unless it covers vast territory.   **Insect and Serpent Friend.** The swamp naga’s link to the swamp extends to many creatures within it. Humanoids and mammalian animals that share the swamp with the naga recognize it as a protector and rarely trouble it, though the naga exerts no control over them. A cloud of poisonous biting and stinging insects accompanies the naga, endangering those who draw close to it.   **Necessarily Ruthless.** Scholars who have studied the connection between swamp nagas and their domains postulate the nagas’ malevolence is an outgrowth of swamplands’ inherent evil. However, the nagas only use force when trespassers actively harm the swamp or refuse to leave after the nagas attempt to reason with them. Nagas typically encourage those they enthrall to either leave or repair damages. They prefer not to take slaves, since this encourages more intruders and likely further havoc.</description>

At the start of each of the bubble’s turns, the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and begins suffocating as it breathes in the poisonous gases within the bubble. A creature is affected even if it holds its breath, but creatures that don’t need to breathe aren’t affected.

The bubble can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so if its target falls unconscious or dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the bubble by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.</text>

  <description>A semi-permeable bubble surrounds a blue-tinged gas. The bubble jauntily bobs in the air._   **Consumers of Exhaled Gases.** Swampgas bubbles feed on concentrated exhalations from living creatures. They surround their victims’ heads and extract these gases, usually in copious quantities as their victims panic and breathe harder. This leads many to believe the bubbles are sadistic. However, encounters with swampgas bubbles are rarely fatal, since the bubbles typically sate themselves by the time their prey falls unconscious, losing interest as the creature’s breathing slows.   **Attracted to Fire.** A swampgas bubble is instinctively drawn to fire, even though they are highly flammable. Its susceptibility to fire makes it relatively easy to dispatch, but its explosive ending makes the use of fire risky for its foes. In fact, this form of death, accompanied by a beautiful burst of blue light, is just part of the bubble’s overall lifecycle. Its outer layer hardens and shatters, and the remaining bits fall into the swamp where they grow and encase swamp gasses, developing into new swampgas bubbles.   **Ooze Nature.** A swampgas bubble doesn’t require sleep.</description>

  <description>Esteron are small, winged salamanders that live in large groups. They cluster around subterranean bodies of water and aggressively protect such places. Some underground creatures see the esteron as a delicacy, but those who hunt esteron know the beasts are quick to form swarms that can easily overwhelm an unprepared hunter.   Esteron are highly sociable, communal creatures, and their communities are not lorded over by a dominant member. Instead, they cooperate with one another peacefully. When two groups of esteron encounter one another, they behave peacefully if the nearby water and food is abundant, sometimes even exchanging members. If resources are scarce, however, the group that inhabits the source of water drives away the outsider group with as little violence as possible.</description>

Tembrils store the heads in the long winter months, hiding them within the hollows of great trees or in other suitable locations and covering them in ice so they don’t decompose.

  <description>This tall, emaciated giant has unnaturally long arms ending in razor-sharp talons. It has a strangely conical head with glowing red eyes and fearsome fangs. Its skin is a dark gray-green, and its body is completely devoid of hair._   **Giant Bogeymen.** Lurking in abandoned mansions, dark wells, ancient mine shafts, and similar locations, thin giants are one of the most sinister and frightening of all giant species. The villains of many children’s nightmares, thin giants are feared even by other giants, as their life-draining bite and ability to get into tight spaces make them unsettling at best and horrifying at worst. Thin giants don’t get along with most creatures, but they have been observed leading groups of ghouls, ettercaps, and trolls to capture and devour prey.   **Contortion Experts.** Thin giants have remarkable control over their bodies. They can twist their limbs into unnatural positions and even bend completely double. The flexibility and elasticity help the giants shrug off crushing blows. They can stay in contorted positions for extraordinary lengths of time and use this to their advantage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.</description>

  <description>Emerging from the surf, this massive crab-like beast has a hard, blue shell covered in barnacles. It holds a net of seaweed between its barbed claws, and a look of intelligence gleams in its elliptical, crimson eyes._   **Lurkers in the Shallows.** The tidehunter is an ambush hunter, using its coloration to surprise prey that venture into the shallows. Tidehunters are normally found along coasts with plentiful beaches and underwater vegetation, but some can be found in large lakes and river systems close to the open ocean. Most tidehunters are more than 20 feet across and are powerful enough to overcome a hunter shark or small whale with ease. They have few natural predators, their intelligence and guile making them challenging prey.   **Net Weavers.** Tidehunters can weave nets out of kelp, seaweed, and other fibrous plant material with ease, constructing nets in a matter of minutes with the weirdly hooked barbs on their claws. Their nets are strong and can be thrown with great accuracy over a large distance. Indeed, even those on dry land are not immune to the tidehunter’s attacks, and more than one human has been hauled into the surging tide from the apparent safety of the beach.   **Fishing Buddies.** While fisherfolk and tidehunters are normally at odds, a tidehunter will sometimes enter into an unspoken agreement with a group of fisherfolk, sharing the spoils of the sea while keeping out of each other’s way.</description>

  <description>This strange dog is hairless except for the thick, dark fur that runs along its bony, ridged back._   **Arctic Legends.** Oral histories of the north are rich with tales of the qiqirn. The tales say they are drawn to mankind’s warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement’s sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.   **Afraid of Civilization.** Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.   **Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn’s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

  <description>A four-armed, four-legged creature in the vague shape of a human—but seemingly made of fine spider silk—moves down a tree, slowly chanting the incantation of a spell in the pale light of the full moon._   **Made in Corrupt Forests.** Lunarchidnas are beings of moonlight and spider silk created in forests permeated by residual dark magic. When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.   **Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.   **Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna’s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.    #### Lunarchidna Moon Phase  Moon Phase  Statistics  Daytime, new, or crescent moon  Open Game License</description>

  <description>A bipedal dinosaur with massive horns on its face, back, and tail roars, revealing an enormous mouth filled with rows of razor teeth._   Tricenatoruses are the rage-filled result of a transmutation experiment gone wrong.   **Unnatural Mistakes.** A transmutation wizard attempted to magically bring together two dinosaurs to create the ultimate guardian, one with the power of the tyrannosaurus and the docile nature of the triceratops. Instead, the wizard created unnatural, spiked monsters with a hunger for flesh and an unmatched rage.   **Always Angry.** From the moment they hatch, tricenatoruses are angry. This rage makes them reckless and difficult to harm. Most of these monstrous dinosaurs stay deep within the jungle, but tricenatoruses are relentless when they find prey, leading them to sometimes chase explorers into civilized settlements.</description>

  <description>Screams echo in the night as spears meet wood and flesh. One trollkin pulls its spear from its latest victim while its companion raids the victim’s larder._   Trollkin raiders are greedy and efficient, moving together under the command of a trollkin leader to take apart a village, a caravan, or a small fortress. Their goal is generally food and portable wealth. Their training as a unit is not extensive but raiders know, trust, and fight for one another.   **Night Attacks.** Trollkin raiders attack in a fast-moving, nocturnal group, often using a group of panicked animals or a fire as a distraction in one place while they attack elsewhere. Their assaults are never daylight attacks over open ground; they much prefer surprise and the confusion of night attacks.   **Mounted or River Routes.** While trollkin raiders can lope for miles across taiga or through forests, they far prefer to ride horses or row up a river. It gives them both speed and the ability to carry more plunder.   Note that in The Raven's Call, the Raider had 78 (12d8 + 24) HP and spoke only Northern Tongue.</description>

After their defeat, the uridimmus chose to serve the god as guardians of the heavenly realm. The tainted origin of uridimmus manifests in the chaotic mass of fire, lightning, and radiance that clings to the heads of their maces.   **Tainted Servants of Law.** Uridimmus are tireless guardians, and most are tasked with guarding the portals into the lawful planes. Some also serve the deities directly as bodyguards or lead groups of lesser celestials in battle. While uridimmus are unwavering and steadfast guardians, they are also completely merciless in combat and not above making examples out of trespassers.

    <name>Prehensile Tendrils</name>
    <text>The valkruung has 10 shiny blue-gray tendrils that constantly grab at things in the environment. Each tendril can pick up or hold a Tiny object, such as a coin or piece of jewelry, that isn’t being worn or carried. If it uses all 10 of its tendrils, the valkruung can carry a single Small object, such as a backpack. The valkruung can use its tendrils to interact with objects, but it can’t use them to wield a weapon. It has advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when using its tendrils and can use its tendrils to disarm opponents (see the Disarming Tendrils reaction).</text>

While poisoned in this way, the target suffers an itchy rash, and, at the start of each of its turns, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving or spend its action furiously scratching the rash. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

    <name>Disarming Tendrils</name>
    <text>When a creature the valkruung can see targets it with a melee weapon attack, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or its weapon is knocked out of its grasp into a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker. The valkruung can’t use this reaction against attackers wielding a heavy or two-handed weapon.</text>

  <description>Standing only a few feet tall, this odd simian creature has charcoal-colored skin and glowing eyes. Thin, blue-gray tendrils cover almost every inch of its body, and it smells faintly of burnt honey._   **Incorrigible Kleptomaniacs.** Few creatures cause as much annoyance to shopkeepers, merchants, and farmers as the valkruung, a tiny monkey-like creature covered in grasping tendrils that lurks atop roofs and clambers through trees, looking for food and objects to steal. Attracted to anything that glitters, jangles, or just plain smells nice, the valkruung steals anything regardless of its actual worth. Valkruungs snatch purses from unsuspecting passersby and fruit and bread from vendors to take back to their lairs. They steal objects they don’t need and refuse to return them, running off while snickering wildly.   **Shrines of Riches.** Anything a valkruung steals and doesn’t eat is placed in a central location in its nest, often around an existing statue, altar, or other large object. Eventually, this object becomes covered in a variety of clutter, some of which may be valuable. A valkruung treats all of its objects equally and attacks anyone who tries to take something from the pile.   **Den of Thieves.** Valkruungs are social creatures and live in groups of ten to twenty. The job of child-rearing is shared by all members of the group equally, and young valkruungs spend the first parts of their lives carried around on various adults’ backs, where the adults’ tendrils keep them safe. Valkruungs are more intelligent than they appear and have a rudimentary grasp of language, typically insults that have been hurled their way.</description>

For each minute a creature stays in the vallowex’s aura, it gains one level of exhaustion from dehydration. A level of exhaustion is removed if the creature uses an action to drink 1 pint of water.

The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the vallowex, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the vallowex’s turns. The vallowex can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the vallowex takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the vallowex must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the vallowex. If the vallowex dies, the swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <name>Release Eggs (1/Week)</name>
    <text>A vallowex can release a 40-foot-radius cloud of microscopic eggs into a body of water it touches. The eggs live for 1 hour. Any humanoid or beast that drinks the eggs must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a vallowex tadpole. A host can carry only one vallowex tadpole to term at a time. While diseased, the host must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. On a failed save, the host’s Strength score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the host’s Strength score is reduced to 0, the host dies, and a vallowex emerges from the corpse. If the host succeeds on three saving throws or the disease is magically cured, the unborn tadpole disintegrates.</text>
  </action>
  <description>A creature with two legs and a flat tail emerges from the water. Its wide mouth opens, revealing a spiked tongue._   **Luring with Thirst.** The vallowex haunts woodland rivers, luring in prey with its thirst-inducing aura. When a creature stops to drink, the vallowex attacks and drags the creature into the water to feast. Reproduce through Hosts. Vallowexes release eggs into potable water. After a creature drinks the eggs, a tadpole hatches in its stomach. The tadpole slowly consumes the host from the inside out, emerging as a vallowex when the host dies.</description>

  <description>A writhing mass of hundreds of rubbery, blue-grey tentacles rises from a human sized pair of legs ending in elephantine feet. Each tentacle ends in an eerily human-looking mouth._   **Damned Pipers.** Vangsluagh create a din everywhere they go; the mouths on their tentacles perpetually scream, whistle, bleat, growl, and cry. Even in instances where a vangsluagh may want a quiet entrance or stealthy ambush, their own bodies betray them. Stories have emerged from their magic-blasted homeland of vangsluagh that are capable of silencing the noise surrounding them.   **Defilers of Beauty.** Vangsluagh despise pretty things, be they creature, object, or structure. Given the opportunity, a vangsluagh prefers spending its time smashing beautiful things to bits. The absence of beauty doesn’t always calm these creatures, however. They target living creatures as a priority in such occurrences.</description>

Its cunning eyes belie a malignant intelligence._   **Bound to Service.** Though they are not devils, vexxeh are natives of the Hells. Their susceptibility to magical domination makes them ideal lieutenants for evil spellcasters. Once a vexxeh has agreed to serve a master, it adheres to the letter of the agreement that has been struck and refuses to break the contract even under the threat of destruction.   **Lovers of Carnage.** Vexxeh only know joy when they are harming living creatures. They relish battle, enjoying the opportunity to shed blood and break bones. More than combat, however, vexxeh enjoy torturing mortals, especially if there is no purpose to it. The psychic distress and trauma suffered by the victims of their torture makes vexxeh gleeful.   **Fiendishly Polite.** Despite their love of violence, vexxeh are unfailingly polite. They mimic the etiquette and social norms of their current master’s culture, going so far as to affect mannerisms of nobility. Even when rending a creature into bloody chunks, a vexxeh acts regretful and apologetic.</description>

  <description>The mouth of this massive flytrap hangs limply, and the smell of decay emanates strongly from it._   **Disease Eater.** Viirets feed on diseased flesh and plant matter. The swamplands they inhabit are rife with maladies, giving them plenty of opportunity to find food. Viirets have an acute sense for diseased matter, regardless of the disease’s source. While they aren’t bothered by eating untainted prey, such prey isn’t as nutritionally satisfying. Their stomachs quickly burn through healthy prey, leaving the viiret hungry shortly afterward.   **Unpleasant Odor.** The viiret has developed a form of mimicry where its sickly odor deters healthy creatures from approaching it. The viiret is even repellent to most insects.   **Desperate Cure.** Marshland societies aware of the viirets’ ability to remove disease often view the plants as agents of harsh deities that demand a price for divine gifts. These societies send plague victims on dangerous pilgrimages to find the plants. The plants devour these pilgrims and remove diseased flesh. This process is dangerous, as many who enter the plant hopeful of eliminating the disease die as a result of the injuries they suffer. To mitigate this, multiple ill people travel together to viirets, optimistic the plants will expel newly healthy specimens in favor of a sickly one.</description>

  <description>Grasping vines form this draconic creature’s wings. Nettlelike teeth fill its maw, and its tail branches like a thriving plant._   **Living Vines.** Vines coil around and branch out from the body of the vine drake, and lengthy thorns protrude from its head and down its spine. The poison dripping from its fangs causes a severe rash on its victims. The drake uses the vines around its body to hide in its swampy home and to squeeze the life out of its prey. Despite the vine drake’s plant-like nature, it is still a carnivorous dragon. It prefers deer and other game animals, but it has no problem eating the odd humanoid when it is truly hungry. In the absence of food, it can subsist, though barely, on sunlight if it spends time sunbathing.   **Avaricious Bullies.** Vine drakes share the typical greed possessed by most dragons and often shake down humanoids for treasure in return for safe passage through the drakes’ territory. They prefer emeralds and other green precious items that blend with their coloration, and they often secret such items deep within the tangle of vines on their bodies. They usually initiate their demands by grabbing unsuspecting victims in their vines and then threatening to strangle their captured prey unless given green treasures. However, they balk at strong resistance and withdraw into undergrowth if grievously harmed or if they face opponents they can’t overcome.   **Flightless Dragons.** Unlike most dragons, vine drakes can’t fly. In their claustrophobic swampy lairs, flight is not necessary. Instead, they use their grasping vines to quickly climb and move from tree to tree to hunt or evade predators.</description>

  <description>A humanoid-shaped tangle of green vines shambles through a portal and gives a friendly wave._   **Druid Servants.** Vine golems are constructs created by druids for use as scouts and guardians. These plant-like constructs maintain a psychic connection with their creators, who can see through their eyes and cast spells through them. The golem-creator connection is maintained across the planes of the multiverse and is severed only if the construct or the druid dies. The vine golem is made from a variety of rare plants and flowers found only in the depths of old-growth forests. The process of creating a vine golem is closely guarded by cabals of druids, who will sometimes gift worthy druids with the knowledge in the form of a manual of vine golems.   **Golems without Creators.** When a vine golem’s creator dies, the construct carries out the druid’s final orders and then retreats to the nearest wilderness. Driven by a psyche fractured from the loss of its creator, the vine golem guards the animals and plants of its chosen home with extreme prejudice, attacking all intruders, regardless of any previous affiliation they might have had with its creator.   **Construct Nature.** A vine golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The beautiful singer bows to the adoring crowd before stepping behind the curtain. Away from the eyes of the crowd, the singer changes its half-mask, briefly revealing a ghastly, undead visage._   A virtuoso lich is an artist whose love of art sustains it beyond death.   **Birthed by Art.** A virtuoso lich is created when an artist powerful in both its artistic and magical expression dies with art left undone. Such artists often die before completing or creating a masterpiece, and the torment of the art left undone couples with the artist’s powerful magical talents, turning the artist into a virtuoso lich. A virtuoso lich is bound to an object of art, such as a favorite musical instrument, painting, dance slippers, quill, or some other object of artistic expression that was significant to the lich in life. This piece of art is the lich’s phylactery.   **Beautiful Mien.** A virtuoso lich maintains the beauty of its former life, appearing much as it did in life—save for one physical feature that betrays its undead nature. This undead feature can be a clawed, skeletal hand, which the lich hides in a glove; a stiff, zombie-like leg, which the lich disguises with robes and a cane; a face ravaged by undeath, which the lich covers in a beautiful mask; or any other appropriate feature.   **Undead Nature.** The virtuoso lich doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.    ## A Virtuoso Lich’s Lair     A virtuoso lich chooses a lair with an eye and ear for artistic potential, whether that lair is an ancient cavern with natural acoustics, a meadow with plentiful natural light, a hall of mirrors, or some other locale capable of enhancing some form of art, allowing the lich’s magic and artistic expression to swell, reaching every corner.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the virtuoso lich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the lich can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The virtuoso lich channels artistic expression it can see or hear into a magical assault. The artistic expression must be of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait, but it otherwise can be any form of expression not originating from the lich, such as the song of nearby singers that echoes in the lair, the colorful paint decorating canvases, the twirling forms of dancers, or similar. The virtuoso lich chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet of the artistic expression. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * The virtuoso lich enhances the natural artistry of its lair, distracting and hindering nearby creatures. The lich chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws against the lich’s spells and its Corrupted Art action until initiative count 20 on the next round. * The virtuoso lich rolls a d4 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.</description>

The humanoids experience profound terror before dying of thirst or suffocation, and their spirits remain trapped within the wall, becoming an undead that seeks to add others to its collection.   **Entombed Treasures.** While the spirits of the entombed victims join with the stone and mortar of the wall, their bodies and belongings are left to rot in the cavity behind the wall. When the walled horror is destroyed, it collapses into a pile of rubble, revealing the remains and belongings.   **Undead Nature.** A walled horror doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>Hurtling down the street is a giant wheel, its spokes tipped with reddish flames that sputter and spark as it bounces along. Affixed to either side of the wheel by long strands of greasy black hair are the faces of devilish-looking humanoids, their eyes ablaze like embers. The two faces chortle and cry as the wheel approaches, fire leaping from their mouths._   **Born of Heresy.** Wanyudos are the souls of powerful lords condemned to an afterlife of burning torment after they refuted the teachings of the gods and were killed in battle or committed suicide. Prideful and violent monsters, wanyudos are lesser fiends in the grander schemes of Hell, a fact they vehemently resent.   **Divine Hunters.** While wanyudos hate all living creatures, the reserve their greatest hatred for creatures marked by a divine entity—such as clerics and paladins, or creatures wearing holy symbols—whom they blame for their cursed existence. When wandering by a monastery or temple, a wanyudo expends every effort to burn the structure to the ground and murder everyone within. Given this, temples and holy sites in areas known to be plagued by wanyudos often fireproof their buildings—and have a reliable source of water nearby, in case the worst should happen.   **To Hell and Back.** Wanyudos never stop moving, endlessly rolling along the roads and pathways between the Hells and the mortal world. Because of this, wanyudos know many secret ways into the planes.</description>

  <description>This creature is round and hovers without the aid of wings. Its skin is a deep red color, with a leathery toughness and texture. It has three forward-facing, segmented eyes and a protruding, bloodstained proboscis._   **Unknown Origins.** The origins of the wardu are unknown, though scholars speculate that they came from the Plateau of Leng. It is said they were introduced to the Material Plane as a result of an ill-fated expedition by a group of wizards to the edges of the multiverse. The wizards were attacked by a horde of wardu who followed them through the planar rift they created to return home. Although the rift was sealed immediately, dozens of the wardu were trapped on the Material Plane and have since reproduced for numerous generations.   **Blood Drinkers.** Wardu are blood drinkers, and it is the only way they absorb sustenance. They are able to attack and gain sustenance from any creature that has blood, no matter the type. Their hunger drives them to attack most creatures they encounter, though they are smart enough to discern the difference between a potential food source and a more powerful creature not worth provoking.   **Magic Hunters.** Wardus have a thirst for the blood of spellcasters and even put themselves at risk to obtain that tastiest of treats. Drinking arcane-infused blood has imbued the wardu with some magical power. It can channel this power through its central eye, but the segmented nature of its eye causes the magic to become unstable and scatter as it passes through the eye’s facets.</description>

They attempted to use this power to overthrow the Queen… and failed. The Queen, amused, allowed them to live, but with a nasty curse: warmth thieves must steal body heat to live, perishing if they don’t regularly take heat from living creatures. Warmth thieves can’t tolerate temperatures much above freezing, preventing them from subverting the curse by moving to warmer climates. Their desire for warmth is so powerful they sometimes throw themselves at creatures that can magically create fire to enjoy a brief, though painful, respite from their suffering.   **Unintended Side Effects.** Unknown to the Queen, her curse transfers in an odd way to mortal beings who die at the warmth thieves’ bone-chilling touch.

  <description>This feathered humanoid has piercing eyes, larger than normal for a humanoid’s head, set around a sharp beak. Wings spread from its arms, and its feet end in wicked talons._   A wereowl is a hybrid creature usually in service to a powerful creature with dominion over flying creatures. The affinity between owls and elves means that most wereowls are elves, rather than the humans typical among other lycanthropes. The wereowl possesses the keen eyesight that is common to owls, as well as the birds’ preternatural ability to fly silently. Its appetite tends toward its avian nature, and it feasts on rodents and other small mammals, usually raw and directly after a successful hunt. Its attitudes toward rodents extends to wererats and rodentlike creatures, such as ratfolk, and it often prefers to attack such creatures to the exclusion of other foes.</description>

  <description>The twisted form of a humanoid shark hunches over, its grin showing rows of jagged teeth. Fresh blood drips from its mouth as it clutches a trident in powerful hands._   In humanoid form, weresharks tend to be powerfully-muscled and broad, with little body hair. They are solitary hunters who sometimes stalk and eat each other. If a wereshark spreads its curse, it’s likely because the lycanthrope made a mistake and let potential prey get away.   **Voracious Appetites.** Weresharks are savage predators who, driven by voracious appetites, devour anything they come across. Aggressive in all forms, weresharks prefer to spend their time beneath the waves, hunting fish, seals, and other prey. They have no qualms about attacking humanoids or boats, particularly fishing vessels, which contain even more food for the lycanthrope to consume.   **Obsessed Predators.** Weresharks become obsessed with prey that gets away from them. A wereshark can stalk an individual through the seas and over land for months, leaving a path of destruction behind it, just to get a taste of what it missed.</description>

Fortunately, werynax are solitary creatures, though female werynax are fiercely protective of their young and may have a litter of up to a dozen offspring. Most werynax live in forests and grasslands.   **Strange Habits.** Why and how werynax feed on the magical energy of the natural world has baffled sages and scholars throughout the centuries, though it is clear that the energy werynax consume grants them their magical abilities. Some sages point to magical experimentation on the part of an insane lich or fey lord, while others lay the blame at the feet of the gods, believing the werynax to be some form of divine punishment for misusing the land. Many druids, however, speculate the werynax is an integral part of the natural order—just as death and decay are part of the life cycle, so too is the werynax part of the land’s natural cycle.</description>

    <text>The willowhaunt’s skeletal form is covered with a magical illusion that makes it look like a living willow tree. The willowhaunt can use a bonus action to dismiss this illusion until the end of its next turn.

The changes wrought by this illusion fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the willowhaunt’s trunk appears to be made of bark, but someone touching it would feel the tree’s polished bones. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the willowhaunt’s true appearance.</text>

    <text>The willowhaunt chooses up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with murderous intent for 1 minute. While overcome with murderous intent, a creature has advantage on melee attack rolls and is compelled to kill creatures within 30 feet of the willowhaunt. The creature is unable to distinguish friend from foe and must attack the nearest creature other than the willowhaunt each turn. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, it stalks off in a random direction, seeking a new target to drag within 30 feet of the willowhaunt. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and is afflicted with short term madness. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t afflicted with madness. If a saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is afflicted with long term madness instead. A creature afflicted with madness caused by the willowhaunt’s whispers has disadvantage on its saving throw against the Willowhaunt’s Provoke Murder.</text>

  <description>The ghostly image of a healthy willow overlays a smaller tree composed of bones. Piles of bones litter the ground at its base._   **Death Tree.** When victims of murder or other violent deaths die in view of an otherwise healthy willow tree, their spirits flock to the tree. This destroys the willow and causes it to return as a mockery of a living tree. The willowhaunt projects an image of its former appearance to put creatures at ease, at least long enough to convince them to approach.   **Thirst for Blood.** Willowhaunts thrive best in blood-soaked soil. They incite murderousness in those who come near by telepathically whispering conspiracies about a creature’s allies. The willowhaunts encourage their victims to make small sacrifices to the willows, ensuring the willowhaunt’s soil remains bloody.   **Attractive to Death Cults.** Swamp-based death cults cherish the discovery of a willowhaunt and sacrifice victims to create a grove of willowhaunts. Perversely, a willowhaunt prefers blood shed by unwilling creatures, and it demands the cultists bring victims it can force into a fight.   **Undead Nature.** The willowhaunt doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <text>When a creature that can see the windy wailer starts its turn within 30 feet of the wailer, the wailer can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the wailer isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 as it is mesmerized by the windy wailer.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the windy wailer until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.

Caught eternally in the last moments that took its life, the windy wailer seeks to spread its misery to others, raising the elements to overturn ships and drown sailors.   **Found in Storms.** Windy wailers are normally encountered in the midst of a great storm or other turbulent weather where they can hide amid the wind and rain before launching their attacks. They often strike when a group of sailors are at their most vulnerable, such as when the ship is close to rocks, the rigging has been damaged, or someone has been knocked overboard.   **Unusual Allies.** Aquatic undead, Open Game License</description>

Since the opportunity for meals is diminished in less populated tundra, winterghasts are careful to avoid spawning additional winterghasts through the disease they inflict. This outlook also prevents winterghasts from gathering in large numbers, but they sometimes form clans for mutual protection and to keep other winterghasts from hunting in their territories. When times become lean, these clans often tear each other apart through infighting, and the survivors scatter to hunt in solitude.   **Scorned by Darakhul.** Even from their underground kingdoms, Open Game License</description>

  <description>This squat creature is covered in furs, making it almost as wide as it is tall. A large nose pokes through the furs, and its gentle eyes shine._   **Spirit of Hospitality.** Wintergrims are solitary fey who build their homes in remote locations. When they are alone, they spend much of their time traversing the territory surrounding their homes, watchful for creatures in dire straits or in need of shelter. Wintergrims offer assistance and lodging to travelers they encounter and jump to the rescue for those in immediate peril. They readily share the furs in which they bundle themselves and are often laden with warm soups and beverages they share with visitors suffering from the elements.   **Inscrutable Rules.** A wintergrim’s hospitality has limits, as each wintergrim has a unique set of behaviors it holds taboo within the confines of its home. Breaking its rules is so abhorrent to a wintergrim, it dares not even discuss the things it forbids. The rules range from the seemingly innocuous—such as leaving one’s boots on when entering a wintergrim’s home—to common societal norms—such as not attacking or killing another guest. Discovering a wintergrim’s proscribed behavior is difficult, since the wintergrim ignores transgressions outside its home, perhaps giving a cryptic warning that it wouldn’t tolerate the same in its domicile. Mere discussion about its rules may also provoke the fey.   Whatever the case, wintergrims demand rulebreakers leave their premises at once, resorting to pummeling those who fail to comply.   **Competent Woodsfolk.** As loners with occasional guests, wintergrims are necessarily self-sustaining. They are omnivorous, and they grow gardens, set traps, and hunt for their food. Though they are inured to cold temperatures, they enjoy having a house in which they can reside and share their hospitality. They are adept with the axes they wield to chop down trees for their homes and fires, but they are careful not to overharvest wood. Other than when they hunt, they rarely use their axes as weapons. They prefer to punch their opponents in the hope they can drive their foes away, resorting to their axes only in desperate situations.</description>

  <description>This flabby creature squints with beady eyes, licks its lips, and places a bone-white hand to the gaping hole punched through its chest._   **Miserable Visage.** Woe siphons are a sad sight when compared to their beautiful and terrible fey brethren. They appear as misshapen humanoids with translucent, glossy skin. All woe siphons possess a through-and-through hole in the chest where their heart should be. When underfed, this hole appears ragged and torn, like a fresh wound. When well-fed, a fragile layer of skin forms over the gap.   **Pain Gorger.** Woe siphons feed on negative emotions. To sustain themselves, many migrate to places where sentient creatures suffer in vast numbers or where historical suffering took place, such as mass graves or ancient battlefields. Particularly deadly or dangerous underground locales are common hunting grounds of the hungry woe siphon. Once inside such a place, a woe siphon inflicts suffering on any who cross its path. A favorite tactic involves invisibly stalking adventuring parties to torment their victims for as long as possible before attacking outright.</description>

  <description>This human-shaped amalgam of wood, leather, and forest debris lumbers forward on uneven legs._   In remote villages plagued by evil spirits, locals erect wood and straw people to ward against the spirits in much the same way farmers use similar figures to ward against crows.   **Animated Protectors.** When great danger threatens the village, ancient rituals that are passed from generation to generation can be invoked to awaken the wards to defend the village. Wood wards aren’t awakened lightly, however, as the villagers rarely possess the rituals to return the wards to their slumber.   **Implements of Terror.** Unknown to most villages that possess them, wood wards were originally created by evil druids to sow terror in logging villages that were encroaching on the forest. The druids circulated wards around these villages, spreading rumors of their protective capabilities. Most of the druids succumbed to age, heroes, or other forces before getting the chance to enact their schemes, and the villages continued on with wards that did exactly as rumored. Some druid circles still possess the knowledge for awakening the true nature of the wood wards, and stories have surfaced of villages in the darkest depths of the forest going silent, possessing nothing but empty houses and a wall of silent wood wards.   **Construct Nature.** A wood ward doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The black, spectral form of an enormous bear with burning red eyes lets loose a bone-chilling roar._   **Corrupted Spirits.** Bear spirits are believed to be the spirits of ancestral warriors and guardians that take on the form of a bear to aid their descendants. Necromancers and dark shamans know magic that twists the mind of these spirits, causing them to feel anger and malice toward the family they once protected. These wraith bears hunt and murder their descendants, listening to no other commands until they have murdered what remains of their family. When this mission is complete, the wraith bear returns to its corruptor, following orders loyally.   **Forest Haunters.** If a wraith bear’s corruptor dies and the creature has no family left to hunt, it retreats to the forest. There the bear wanders, its hatred for all life a festering madness that drives it to violence. The wraith bear’s mere presence begins to kill nearby plant life, and it attacks any living creature it finds.   **Restored by Archfey.** A wraith bear can be reinstated as a bear spirit by the touch of a fey lord or lady. Finding a fey lord or lady is difficult enough, but convincing it to take on such a task usually involves paying a heavy price.   **Undead Nature.** A wraith bear doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>This headless brute has two eyes in its chest and a mouth in its belly._   **Descendants of a Fallen God.** All xing tian descend from a god of the same name who challenged the eldest deities and lost. As punishment, his head was removed, but he simply grew eyes and a mouth on his chest and continued to fight.   **Fearless Warriors.** The xing tian, known by locals as “headless giants,” live on the fringes of civilization, occasionally raiding settlements for plunder and loot. They dwell in small, isolated villages where leadership roles go to the individuals who can withstand the most pain. The most powerful xing tian wear their hideous scars with pride.   **Symbol of Perseverance.** The xing tian’s fortitude and regenerative properties lead many to consider them a symbol of an indomitable will and the drive to continue no matter the hardships.</description>

  <description>This long-nosed, fox-like humanoid gestures silently with a smile on its lips and a twinkle in its eyes._   Yaojing find peace traveling the wilds and quietly helping homesteaders and other travelers. They appear to be wiry redheaded men in light clothing. Their features are a mix of human and fox with a long nose, weak chin, and clever eyes.   **Silent Servitors.** Before they arrive on the Material Plane, yaojing take a vow of silence. Their vow precludes them from using their telepathy or voice to communicate with mortals. If a yaojing under vow is forced to communicate with more than sign or body language, it must retire to its planar home to live in silent contemplation for 108 years before it can once again travel the Material.   **Charlatan Haters.** Yaojing hate nothing so much as those who would use a mortal’s faith in the gods against them. When yaojing encounter such shysters in their travels, they work tirelessly to bring the charlatans to justice and remove the blight such creatures represent. Yaojing prefer to turn the charlatans over to local authorities for punishment appropriate to the laws of the land they are traveling, but they take on the role of judge when representatives of the law are absent.   **Mountain Mystics.** Some yaojing take up a monastic life. They build shrines on mountaintops where they silently teach their small congregations of adherents the joys of a quiet life of service and contemplation. They also teach their disciples how to avoid being fooled by charlatans and that harmonious societies must be free of such liars.</description>

  <description>This large, bestial-looking creature is dark gray, with powerful muscles, long arms, sharp claws at the end of five-digit fingers, fine, short fur, and enormous, bat-like wings. Its face is an odd combination of orc and bat. Its brows are heavy, its nose is a snout, and its mouth is full of sharp teeth. Its ears are tall and pointed._   **Distantly Related to Orcs.** Yathon seem to have just as much in common with bats as they have with orcs. Their species is a seemingly perfect melding of the two, as they have the power and ferocity of the orc but the communal nature, flying, and sonic perception of a bat. It is unknown if they are the product of some mad wizard’s experiment or if they are simply cousins of orcs.   **Communal.** Yathon live in communities of ten to twenty. They are brutal and tribal in nature, and they fight ferociously. Yathon often capture prey in their claws, carry it into the air, and drop it from great heights. Despite their primitive tactics, they have a minor precognition that aids them in battle. This precognition seems to be driven by instinct as much as anything else, but many believe it was a gift from some god.</description>

  <description>Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._   **Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.   **Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as Open Game License</description>

  <description>The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic._   **Dragons of the Spirit World.** Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.   **Colorful and Magical.** Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.   **Masters of Wind and Rain.** Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the Open Game License</description>

  <description>A small house cat gently purrs and twitches its tail. Suddenly it lets loose a blood-curdling yowl as it arches its back. An illusion gives way to the true creature: a rotting undead cat with glowing green eyes, long teeth, and claws like knives._   Yowlers are undead house pets and familiars with a score to settle and a hatred of the living.   **Mistreated in Life.** Many house pets and familiars have terrible masters who mistreat the animals in life.

    <name>Dream Leap</name>
    <text>Once on its turn, the yumerai can use half its movement to step magically into the dreams of a sleeping creature within 5 feet of it. It emerges from the dreams of another sleeping creature within 1 mile of the first sleeper, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second sleeper. If there is no other sleeping creature within range when it uses this trait, the yumerai is stunned until the end of its next turn.</text>

    <name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
    <text>The yumerai’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: dancing lights, message, minor illusion
3/day each: detect thoughts, silent image, sleep

The yumerai can issue simple commands to the creature, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature takes damage, receives a suicidal command, is told to move into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, or is grappled while carrying out the order, it can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, awakening and ending the yumerai’s control on a success. The yumerai can control only one sleeping creature at a time. If it takes control of another, the effect on the previous target ends.</text>

  <description>A slender creature with silvery skin moves delicately, as though unsure if the world around it is real. Star-like motes of white light dance in its black eyes._   A race of fey said to be born from the dreams of an ancient primeval being, yumerai walk in two worlds. Humanoid in appearance, they possess skin tones that range from pale silver to dark gray. Intrinsically tied to the dream world, they can use sleeping creatures as both weapons and transportation.   **Alien Minds.** Although yumerai spend most of their time in the waking world, they have difficulty remembering the differences between dreams and reality. This leads some to misunderstand basic laws of physics or to believe dreams events were real events.   **Dream Walkers.** A yumerai can enter an individual’s dreams and use those dreams as a means of transportation to another’s dreams. This process brief connects the creatures, though the yumerai tries not to make its presence known. When multiple people have the same dream, they may have had a yumerai pass through their sleeping minds.   **The Gift of Sleep.** For a yumerai, sleep serves as both a tool and a gift. As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.   **The Horror of Nightmares.** Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.   **Dream Walker.** A yumerai doesn’t require sleep.</description>

  <description>Waves of heat shimmer around a gigantic vulturelike creature made of sand. The sand crackles with dark energy, and the creature’s eyes burn with malign intelligence._   An enormous vulture forged from sand and malignant power, a zalikum is created by mages who capture souls of the damned and infuse them into the superheated sands of the desert.   **Abyssal Ties.** The souls infusing a zalikum are from the Abyss. A zalikum’s creator can gather these souls from the Abyss themselves, but, more often, the creator makes a deal with a demon in exchange for the souls. Unfortunately for the creator, the demon usually hands over souls that aren’t the easiest to control, leading many creators to die at the talons of their zalikums. Such destruction frees the demon from its bonds, releasing it and the zalikum into the world.   **Innumerable Lives.** The souls infusing the sand of the zalikum can reform it after it has been destroyed. This process consumes some of the power of the souls, forcing the zalikum to devour more souls to fuel further rebirths.   **Construct Nature.** A zalikum doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>The mumbling humanoid alternates between bursts of speed and inactivity as it struggles to focus on the reality around it._   Caught in a chronological maelstrom, zeitgeists struggle to interact with whatever reality presents itself in that moment. Zeitgeists are humanoids who were warped by some misuse or accident of time magic. They are “ghosts” of time, flittering from plane to plane, timeline to timeline, unable to anchor themselves with any sort of stability for long.   **Fast and Slow.** Warped by time magic, a zeitgeist finds itself alternating between speeding around its foes and being barely able to keep up with them. This alternating is random and outside of the zeitgeist’s control, often pulling it forward in the middle of a conversation or slowing it when attempting to escape an enemy.   **Unstable Body and Mind.** The constant instability of being pulled between planes and timelines leaves zeitgeists unable to focus, at best, and deranged, at worst. If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.   **Still Living.** Though named “ghosts,” zeitgeists aren’t dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a ghost, a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time. The location might be the site of the magical mishap that created it, a place steeped in planar or time magic, or a place stable enough in time to help the zeitgeist anchor itself and its sanity.   **Timewarped Nature.** A zeitgeist doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

* Bestow Luck. The target has advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw (zouyu’s choice) it makes before the end of its next turn. 
* Steal Luck. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw (zouyu’s choice) it makes before the end of its next turn. If the target fails the saving throw, the zouyu has advantage on one attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn.</text>

  <description>This elephant-sized feline has sleek fur, four upward-turned fangs in its mouth, and a long tail ending in multiple strands like a pheasant._   **Familial Bonds.** Zouyu live as mated pairs with large territories. The great felines are gentle and social creatures, often overlapping their territories for mutual protection.   **Good Luck.** For many, the zouyu are symbols of good luck and fortune. The tail feather of a zouyu, freely given, can be rendered into a liquid, which produces a luck potion. The potion brings minor good fortune, such as finding a fruit tree when hungry or shelter when it rains, to the drinker for a day. If a tail feather is taken without the zouyu’s knowledge, the potion created by the feather bestows bad luck on the drinker for a day. Such bad luck manifests as the drinker tripping over a too-perfectly-placed rock or a lightning strike felling a tree onto the drinker’s path.   **Herbivores.** Despite their fangs and sharp claws, zouyu are herbivores. Their preferred meals consist of fruit, bamboo leaves, and insects. The zouyu can survive on a very small amount of food despite their size.</description>
