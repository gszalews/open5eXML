    <text>If damage reduces the nihileth to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the nihileth drops to 1 hit point instead.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Dual State</name>
    <text>A nihileth exists upon the Material Plane in one of two forms and can switch between them at will. In its material form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical attacks. In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical attacks. The creature's ethereal form appears as a dark purple outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within. A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Void Aura</name>
    <text>The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition, any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a nihilethic zombie takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn within the aura.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Infecting Telepathy</name>
    <text>If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth can spread its disease to the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or become infected with the same disease caused by the nihileth's tentacle attack.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Nihileth's Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can take a lair action to create one of the magical effects as per an aboleth, or the void absorbance action listed below. The nihileth cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Void Absorbance: A nihileth can pull the life force from those it has converted to nihilethic zombies to replenish its own life. This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action, it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Regional Effects</name>
    <text>the regional effects of a nihileth's lair are the same as that of an aboleth, except as following.

- Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth's lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the disease of the nihileth. A creature who drinks from such water must make a successful DC 14 Constitution check or become infected.</text>

The disease has no effect for 1 minute; during that time, it can be removed by lesser restoration or comparable magic. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is entirely underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in 1d6 rounds as a nihilethic zombie. This zombie is permanently dominated by the nihileth.</text>

The charmed target is under the nihileth's control and can't take reactions, and the nihileth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

In adolescence, this fey creature adopts features that meet the superficial ideals of the nearest humanoid population: long‐legged elegance near elves, a stout figure with lustrous hair near dwarves, unscarred or emerald skin near goblins.   **Jealous and Cruel.** Abominable beauties are so consumed with being the most beautiful creature in the region that they almost invariably grow jealous and paranoid about potential rivals. Because such an abominable beauty cannot abide competition, she seeks to kill anyone whose beauty is compared to her own.   **Male of the Species.** Male abominable beauties are rare but even more jealous in their rages.</description>

  <description>_A gaunt figure in a tattered black mantle shrouded in a cloud of whirling sand. Thin cracks run across its papyrus-dry skin and around its hollow, black eyes._   **Cursed to Wander and Thirst.** Accursed defilers are the remnants of an ancient tribe that desecrated a sacred oasis. For their crime, the wrathful spirits cursed the tribe to forever wander the wastes attempting to quench an insatiable thirst. Each defiler carries a parched sandstorm within its lungs and in the flowing sand in its veins. Wherever they roam, they leave only the desiccated husks of their victims littering the sand.   **Unceasing Hatred.** The desperate or foolish sometimes try to speak with these ill-fated creatures in their archaic native tongue, to learn their secrets or to bargain for their services, but a defiler’s heart is blackened with hate and despair, leaving room for naught but woe.   **Servants to Great Evil.** On very rare occasions, accursed defilers serve evil high priests, fext, or soulsworn warlocks as bodyguards and zealous destroyers, eager to spread the withering desert’s hand to new lands.   **Undead Nature.** An accursed defiler doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Alas are born from galls that grow on treant trunks. Within this parasitic pocket, an ala sickens the treant and consumes its life force. When the treant dies, the ala is born in a black whirlwind._   **Daughters of the Whirlwind.** Alas have windblown hair and wear smoky black rags, but their true form is that of a whirlwind, which can always be seen by šestaci, those men and women with six digits on each hand. In flight or in battle, an ala takes on a form with the upper body of a hag and a whirling vortex of air in place of hips and legs. When an ala enters a house in human form, the whole building groans in protest, as if it had been struck by a powerful stormwind.   Alas live in the hollows of trees that were struck by lightning. They are most active when thunder rocks the forest, and when they travel hail or thunderstorms spawn around them.   **Enormous Appetites.**The huge-mouthed alas have voracious appetites. In the wild, they devour wolves, bears, and badgers. They prefer to hunt in settled areas, however, because they favor the taste of innocents above all else. Unsavory tribes of savage humanoids may beg an ala’s favor (or divert its wrath) with gifts of bound captives.   **Energized by Storms.** In battle, an ala is constantly on the move, weaving between foes like the wind. It tears at its foes with claws and a poisonous bite, or throws wicked lightning bolts and hailstorms from afar. Woe betides the hero who confronts an ala while a storm rages overhead, because such storms energize the ala and make its lightning stronger. Because alas wield lightning with such mastery, some sages associate them with the god of lightning.</description>

  <description>_Sometimes called folding angels, algoriths are lawful beings made from sheer force, pure math, and universal physical laws._   **Creatures of Pure Reason.**They are the border guards of the Conceptual Realms, warding subjective beings from the Realms of the Absolute. Eternal, remorseless, and unceasingly vigilant, they guard against the monstrosities that lurk in the multiverse’s most obscure dimensions, and seek out and eliminate chaos even from the abodes of the gods.   **Foes of Chaos.**They visit mortal realms when chaos threatens to unravel a location, or when the skeins of fate are tangled. On some occasions, an algorith will serve a god of Law or answer the summons of a skein witch.   Algoriths fight with conjured blades of force, and they can also summon universal energy that deconstructs randomness, weakening enemies or reducing them to finely ordered crystalline dust.   **Social but Mysterious.** In groups, they move and fight in silent coordination. Only tiny variations in the formulas etched into their skins identify one algorith from another. Five is a number of extreme importance to all algoriths, but few are willing (or able) to explain why to anyone who isn’t an algorith. Algoriths may have castes, ranks, or commanders, but no mortal has decoded the mathematical blazons adorning their flesh.The algoriths themselves refuse to discuss these formulas with those who do not comprehend them.   **Constructed Nature.** An algorith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Alseids are the graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, with the slender upper body of an elf and the lower body of a deer. Because they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home, they are sometimes called “grove nymphs,” despite being more closely related to elves than nymphs._   **Forest Guardians.** Alseids see the forest as an individual and a friend.They are suspicious of outsiders who do not share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate deep respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid’s white tail; if they chase after it as it bounds away, the sympathetic alseid may lead it toward a road or trail that can carry them out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom. Alseids have no compunction about slaughtering trespassers who burn or cut down their forest.   **Antlers Show Status.** Alseids have antlers growing from their foreheads.These antlers grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life. Further points only develop with the blessing of the forest. No fourteen-point imperial alseids are known to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with thirteen points. Because antlers signify status, alseids never use them in combat. Cutting an alseid’s antlers entirely off or just removing points is a humiliating and grave punishment.   **White-Tailed Wanderers.** Alseids have a deep connection with forest magic of all kinds, and their leaders favor the druid and ranger classes.</description>

  <description>_The amphiptere is most commonly found as a flight of gold-crested, bat-winged serpents bursting from the foliage._   **Tiny Wyverns.** An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger similar to a wyvern’s at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.   **Swooping and Swift.** They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.   **Strength in Flocks.** Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they tend to lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.</description>

  <description>_A gigantic, black-headed snake is over 60 feet long and sheathed in brilliant scales, each andrenjinyi is splashed with vibrant patterns of every imaginable color. The air around these serpents is heavy, redolent of the quenched red desert after a torrential thunderstorm._   Andrenjinyi are the descendants of the Rainbow Serpent, the first and greatest spirit of the world’s beginning.The Rainbow Serpent’s children are dichotomous nature spirits of land and sky, sun and rain, male and female, and birth and destruction.   **Last of their Kind.** The Rainbow Serpent shed andrenjinyi like cast-off scales during her primordial wanderings, but she has created no more since she ascended to the stars. While andrenjinyi are ageless fertility spirits, they cannot themselves reproduce; each one is an irreplaceable link to primeval creation.   **Hunt and Transform.** Andrenjinyi are naturally aquatic, preferring to live in deep, fresh, life- giving rivers and lakes.The serpents usually attack intruders unless they approach with the correct rites or offerings, which require a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check.   Andrenjinyi hunt as other animals do, but they transform devoured prey into unique species with their Transmuting Gullet ability, creating mixed gender pairs. An andrenjinyi’s sacred pool and surroundings often shelters a menagerie of strange and beautiful animals.   **Demand Obedience and Ritual.** When offered rituals and obedience, andrenjinyi sometimes protect nearby communities with drought-breaking rains, cures for afflictions, or the destruction of rivals. Revered andrenjinyi take offense when their petitioners break fertility and familial edicts, such as prohibitions on incest, rape, and matricide, but also obscure obligations including soothing crying infants and the ritual sacrifice of menstrual blood. Punishments are malevolently disproportionate, often inflicted on the whole community and including baking drought, flooding rains, petrification, pestilence, and animalistic violence.Thus, tying a community’s well-being to an andrenjinyi is a double-edged sword.</description>

  <description>_This withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags. They can pull back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust._   In certain tribes, the breaking of local taboos invites terrible retribution from ancestral spirits, especially if the transgressor was a tribal leader or elder. The transgressor is cursed and cast out from the tribe, and then hunted and executed.   **Bound Remains Entombed.** The body is wrapped head to toe in lamba cloth to soothe the spirit and to bind it within the mortal husk, then sealed in a tomb far from traditional burial grounds so none may disturb it and its unclean spirit does not taint the blessed dead.   **Slow Ritual Cleansing.** Each such body is visited every ten years as the tribe performs the famadihana ritual, replacing the lamba bindings and soothing the suffering of the ancestors. Over generations, this ritual expiates their guilt, until at last the once‑accursed ancestor is admitted through the gates of the afterlife. If a spirit’s descendants abandon their task, or if the sealed tomb is violated, the accursed soul becomes an angatra.   **Angry Spirit.** The creature’s form becomes animated by a powerful and malicious ancestor spirit and undergoes a horrible metamorphosis within its decaying cocoon. Its fingernails grow into scabrous claws, its skin becomes hard and leathery, and its withered form is imbued with unnatural speed and agility. Within days, the angatra gathers strength and tears its bindings into rags. It seeks out its descendants to to share the torment and wrath it endured while its spirit lingered.</description>

All chained angels have halos of pure black, and many have been flayed of their skin along one or more limbs._   **Broken and Chained.** These angels have been captured by fiends, tortured, and turned to serve darkness. A pack of chained angels is considered a status symbol among the servants of evil. A chained angel fights for the forces of evil as long as they remain chained, and this amuses demons and devils greatly.   **Chance at Redemption.** However, while their souls are tainted with the blood of innocents, in their hearts chained angels still hope to be redeemed, or at least to be given the solace of extinction. Any creature that kills a chained angel is given a gift of gratitude for the release of death, in the form of all the effects of a heroes' feast spell. If it cannot be redeemed, a chained angel is a storm of destruction.</description>

    <text>A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check must be made to spot angler worm snare lines, and the check is always made with disadvantage unless the searcher has some means of overcoming the snares' invisibility. A creature that enters a space containing angler worm snare lines must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the sticky snares (escape DC 14). This saving throw is made with disadvantage if the creature was unaware of the snare lines' presence.</text>

Hit: 13 (3d8) acid damage, and the target creature must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled adjacent to the angler worm (if it wasn't already) and grappled in the angler worm's coils (escape DC 12). While grappled this way, the creature is restrained by the angler worm (but not by its snare lines), it can't breathe, and it takes 22 (5d8) acid damage at the start of each of the angler worm's turns. A creature that escapes from the angler worm's coils may need to make an immediate DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being restrained again, if it escapes into a space occupied by more snare lines.</text>

    <text>The angler worm selects a spot within 20 feet of itself; that spot glows with a faint, blue light until the start of the worm's next turn. All other creatures that can see the light at the start of their turn must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of their next turn. A creature charmed this way must Dash toward the light by the most direct route, automatically fails saving throws against being restrained by snare lines, and treats the angler worm as invisible.</text>

  <description>_As patient as a fisherman, the angler worm lights a beacon in the darkness and waits for its next meal._   **Silk Snares.** The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its snares while remaining safely hidden itself, emerging only to feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler worm eventually.</description>

  <description>_Several pony-sized ants swarm around an ant the size of a draft horse, clacking their serrated mandibles and threatening with their stingers._   Giant ants look much like a normal ant with six legs, a waspish segmented body, and large antenna. Their hides are covered in thick chitin, and they have large, serrated mandibles flanking their mouths and stingers on their tails. These stingers are the size of a shortsword, and they’re capable of stabbing and poisoning a human to death.   **Colony Defenders.** Giant ants form colonies under the control of a queen much like their normal-sized cousins. Sterile females form castes with the workers building the nest and caring for larvae. Queens and male drones rarely leave the colony. Soldiers defend the colony and forage for food.   **Carry Prey Home.** Giant ants are both predators and scavengers, working in organized groups to bring down large prey and carry it back to the nest. Giant ants tend to ignore animals away from the colony when not foraging for food, but they quickly move to overwhelm prey when hungry or threatened. A giant ant stands nearly four feet tall and weighs 400 pounds, while a giant ant queen is over five feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. Giant ants communicate with each other primarily with pheromones but also use sound and touch.</description>

The area is heavily obscured, and each creature other than an anubian that enters the sandstorm or ends its turn there must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. Also, each creature other than an anubian that ends its turn inside the sandstorm takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage. The anubian can maintain the haboob for up to 10 minutes as if concentrating on a spell. While maintaining the haboob, the anubian's speed is reduced to 5 feet and it can't sand step. Creatures restrained by the sandstorm move with the anubian. A creature can free itself or an adjacent creature from the sandstorm by using its action and making a DC 13 Strength check. A successful check ends the restraint on the target creature.</text>

  <description>_An anubian’s swirling sand comes together to form a snarling, canine-faced humanoid whose eyes shine with an eerie, blue glow. Anubians are elementals summoned to guard tombs or protect treasures._   **Piles of Dust.** An anubian at rest resembles a pile of sand or dust, often strewn about an already dusty location. When active, it rises up to form a muscular humanoid with the head of a jackal. A destroyed anubian collapses into an inert pile of sand.   **Death to the Unarmored.** In combat, anubians prefer to fight unarmored foes rather than creatures wearing armor. They associate unarmored creatures with spellcasters, and their latent resentment over centuries of being summoned as servants drives them to attack such figures when they aren’t shackled by magical bondage.   **Sandstorm Tag Teams.** Anubians fight effectively as teams, using their haboob attacks to corner and isolate the most vulnerable targets.   **Elemental Nature.** An anubian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Long, simian arms snake through the trees like furred serpents, dangling from a shaggy, striped ape in the leafy canopy above and trying to snare those below._   An arboreal grappler is a malformed creation of the gods, a primate whose legs warped into long, muscular tentacles covered in shaggy, red fur.   **Carry Prey to the Heights.** Arboreal grapplers use their long limbs to snatch prey and drag it behind them as they use their powerful forelimbs to ascend to the highest canopy. Their victims are constricted until their struggles cease and then are devoured. Their flexible tentacles are ill-suited for terrestrial movement; they must drag themselves clumsily across open ground too wide to swing across.   **Clans in the Canopy.** Arboreal grappler tribes build family nests decorated with bones and prized relics of past hunts. These nests are built high in the jungle canopy, typically 80 feet or more above the ground. Clans of 40 or more spread across crude villages atop the trees; in such large settlements, a third of the population are juveniles. These nests are difficult to spot from the ground; a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required. A creature observing an arboreal grappler as it climbs into or out of a nest has advantage on the check.   **Carnivorous Elf Hunters.** Grapplers are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh, elves in particular. Some suggest this arises from hatred as much as from hunger, a cruel combination of fascination and revulsion for the walking limbs of humanoid creatures.</description>

Fear. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 2d4 rounds.

They sometimes accept a personal challenge o respond to accusations of cowardice.   **Caravan Raiders.** They’ve developed different magical abilities that aid them well when they raid caravans for captives to enslave and sell; charming foes into slavery is a favorite tactic.   **Wealth for Status.** They delight in taking plunder from humans and dwarves, not so much for its own sake but as a sign of their power over mortals, and their contempt for those who lack fey blood.</description>

  <description>_An asasonbosam is a hirsute hulk with bulging, bloodshot eyes, often perched high in a tree and ready to seize unwary passersby with talons like rusty hooks._   **Iron Hooks and Fangs.** They resemble hairy ogres from the waist up, but with muscular and flexible legs much longer than those of an ogre. These odd appendages end in feet with hooklike talons, and both the creature’s hooks and its fangs are composed of iron rather than bone or other organic material. These iron fangs and claws mark an asanbosam’s age, not just by their size but also by their color. The youngest specimens have shiny gray hooks and fangs, while older ones have discolored and rusty ones.   **Iron Eaters.** The asanbosam diet includes iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf vegetables, and—in times of desperation— grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake their cravings. The asanbosams’ taste for fresh blood and humanoid flesh led to the folklore that they are vampiric (not true).   **Tree Lairs.** Asanbosams spend most of their lives in trees, where they build nestlike houses or platforms of rope and rough planks. They don’t fear magic; most tribes count at least one spellcaster among its members.</description>

They love playing in thunderstorms and riding lightning bolts between the clouds or between clouds and the ground. They feed off lightning and love to see its effects on other creatures.   **Work with Spellcasters.** Although they aren’t much more than hazardous pests by themselves, more malicious creatures and spellcasters that use lightning as a weapon work with azza gremlins to amplify their own destructiveness.   Azza gremlins stand 12 to 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 8 lb.</description>

A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must also make the Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone. A creature needs to make only one saving throw per 5-foot-square per turn, even if it enters and ends its turn in the area. The slippery effect lasts for 3 rounds.</text>

  <description>_With webbed claws, bulbous eyes, and two nostril-slits that ooze an oily black substance, the creature is not quite hideous—but it might be, if most of it wasn’t concealed by a thick coating of muck and mud._   **Bathing Uglies.** When a bagiennik is alone, it spends its time bathing in local springs, rivers, and marshes. The creature sifts through the muck and silt, extracting substances that enhance its oily secretions. If anything disturbs the creature during its languorous bathing sessions, it angrily retaliates. Once a bagiennik has bathed for four hours it seeks a target for mischief or charity.   **Unpredictable Moods.** One never knows what to expect with a bagiennik. The same creature might aid an injured traveler one day, smear that person with corrosive, acidic oil the next day, and then extend tender care to the burned victim of its own psychotic behavior. If the creature feels beneficent, it heals injured animals or even diseased or injured villagers. If a bagiennik visits a settlement, the ill and infirm approach it cautiously while everyone else hides to avoid provoking its wrath. When a bagiennik leaves its bath in an angry mood, it raves and seeks out animals or humanoids to spray its oil onto. If a victim drops to 0 hit points, the foul-tempered bagiennik applies healing oil to stabilize them, grumbling all the while.   **Acid Oils.** Collecting a dead bagiennik’s black oils must be done within an hour of the creature’s death. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check yields one vial of acid, or two vials if the result was 20 or higher. A bagiennik can use these chemicals either to heal or to harm, but no alchemist or healer has figured out how to reproduce the healing effects. Other than their acidic effect, the secretions lose all potency within moments of being removed from a bagiennik. A bagiennik weighs 250 lb., plus a coating of 20 to 50 lb. of mud and muck.</description>

A charmed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the temple cat's Fascinating Lure for the next 24 hours.

  <description>_A slim feline far larger than any house cat slips from the shadows. Its coat glistens like ink as it chirps, and its tail flicks teasingly as its golden eyes observe the doings in its temple._   **Bred for Magic.** Temple cats of Bastet are thought by some to be celestials, but they are a terrestrial breed, created by the priesthood through generations of enchantment.   **Lazy Temple Pets.** By day, temple cats laze about their shrines and porticos, searching out attention from the faithful and occasionally granting boons when it suits then.   **Fierce Shrine Guardians.** By night, they serve as guardians in their temples, inciting would-be thieves to come close before viciously mauling them. More than one would-be rogue has met his or her fate at the claws and teeth of these slim, black-furred beasts. Bastet temple cats are fierce enemies of temple dogs.</description>

  <description>_Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. It’s a solid slab of muscle that towers imposingly over most humans._   The hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.   **Passionate and Volatile.** Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.</description>

Some are kept and prosper, while others fall into decay and return to the jungle.   **Ichor Drinkers.** In his volcanic temples, the demon lord’s idols weep his ichorous demon blood, which the behtus use to create infusions that give them inhuman strength and speed.

A character who gains a sixth level of exhaustion doesn't die automatically but drops to 0 hit points and must make death saving throws as normal. The exhaustion lasts until the target recovers fully from the cold damage.</text>

  <description>_These small, winter faeries are vicious and deadly. With their pale skin and translucent wings, they blend perfectly into their snowy environment; only their beady black eyes stand out against the snow and ice._   These malevolent ice-sprites are a plague upon the people of snowy climates, ambushing unwary prey with icy arrows and freezing spell-like powers.   **Servants of the North Wind.** Known as “patzinaki” in some dialects of Dwarvish, the beli are the servants of winter gods and venerate the north wind as Boreas and other gods of darker aspects. They are frequent allies with the fraughashar.   **Feast Crashers.** Beli especially delight in disrupting feasts and making off with the holiday cakes—the least deadly of their malicious pranks.   **Fear of Druids.** They have an irrational fear of northern druids and their snow bear companions.</description>

  <description>_These small, winged faeries appear to be made out of gray mist, and can conceal themselves completely in the fogbanks and clouds enshrouding their mountainous lairs._   **Mist Dancers.** These evil and cunning faeries (whose name means “mist dancers” in Old Elvish) overcome their victims by seeping into their lungs and choking them on the bereginyas’s foul essence.   **Mountain Spirits.** They are most commonly found in the highest mountain ranges, often above the treeline, but they can be encountered in any foggy or misty mountainous region. Shepherds and goatherds often leave bits of milk or cheese to placate them; these offerings are certainly welcome during the spring lambing season.</description>

  <description>_This headless giant has a large mouth in its chest, with eyes bulging out on either side of it._   **Always Hungry.** Blemmyes are brutes that savor humanoid flesh, and they see all humanoids as potential meals. Some even have the patience to tend groups of humans, goblins, or halflings like unruly herds, farming them for food and fattening them up for maximum succulence.   **Cannibals.** So great is their hideous hunger that blemmyes are not above eating their own kind; they cull and consume the weakest specimens of their race when other food is scarce. The most terrible habit of these monsters is that they seldom wait for their food to die, or even for a battle to conclude, before launching into a grisly feast.</description>

Bolotis use their magical vortex to immobilize their victims and drag them to a watery death. They delight in storing up larders of victims under winter ice or under logs.   **Fond of Allies.** Bolotis sometimes team up with vodyanoi, miremals, and will-o’-wisps to create cunning ambushes. They are happy with a single kill at a time.</description>

  <description>_A bone collective is almost a fluid; its thousands of tiny bones coalesce into a humanoid form only to disperse in a clattering swarm the next moment. Their tiny bones rustle when they move, a quiet sound similar to sand sliding down a dune._   **Spies and Sneaks.** Bone collectives are not primarily fighters, although they swarm well enough. They prefer to spy and skulk. When cornered, however, they fight without fear or hesitation, seeking to strip the flesh from their foes.   **Zombie Mounts.** Bone collectives’ long finger bones and hooked claws help them climb onto zombie mounts and control them. Bone collectives almost always wear robes or cloaks, the better to pretend to be humanoid. They understand that most creatures find their nature disturbing.   **Feed on Society.** Bone collectives join the societies around them, whether human, goblin, or ghoul. They prey on the living and the dead, using them to replenish lost bones. Occasionally, they choose to serve necromancers, darakhul, some vampires, and liches, all of whom offers magical attunements and vile joys to the collective. They dislike extreme heat, as it makes their bones brittle.</description>

Hallucinations are common, and the fright they induce lends the disease its name. At onset, the infected creature gains two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease is cured by lesser restoration, comparable magic, or rest. The infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease persists. If both levels of exhaustion are removed by successful saving throws, the victim has recovered naturally.</text>

  <description>_A bone crab’s cracked skull scurries forward on bone-white legs. These tainted crustaceans make discarded craniums their home._   **Skull Shells.** Much like an enormous hermit crab, bone crabs inhabit the remains of large fish, humanoids, and other creatures. A bone crab’s spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter, cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. All crabs fight over choice skulls.   **Scavengers of Memory.** Bone crabs are voracious scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on the brains. Centuries of such feeding have given bone crabs a collective intelligence. Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.   Bone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures stranded in tidal pools. They drag aquatic prey above the high tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. They pick corpses clean in a few hours, so their hunting grounds are littered with cracked and sun-bleached bones—the perfect hiding place for these littoral predators.   **White Ghost Shivers.** Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease—white ghost shivers, which wrack victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a bone crab’s unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it. Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while ignoring the area’s regulars.</description>

A scattering of bones rolls across the ground, then rises into the air, billowing like a sheet._   **Swarms of Fallen.** On rare occasions, the pugnacious spirits of fallen undead join together, bonded by a common craving: to feel alive again. They gather up their bones from life, as well as any other bones they come across, and form bone swarms.   **Nomadic Undead.** These swarms then ravage the countryside wresting life from living creatures, grabbing livestock, humanoids, and even dragons, digging in their claws in an attempt to cling to life. Bone swarms with one or more sets of jaws wail constantly in their sorrow, interrupting their cries with snippets of rational but scattered speech declaiming their woes and despair.   **Cliff and Pit Dwellers.** Bone swarms gather near cliffs, crevasses, and pits in the hope of forcing a victim or an entire herd of animals to fall to its death, creating more shattered bones to add to their mass.   **Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A hulking, hyena-faced humanoid with heavily scarred, oversized muzzle, a bouda looks as if its jaw had once been ripped apart and put back together. Clouds of gnats and fleas roil around its arms._   **Glowing Eyes and Teeth.** Bouda are child-eaters, despoilers of purity and family. Resembling oversized gnolls, a web of scars along their muzzles is evidence of their gluttonous eating habits. Forever leering, their teeth glow as yellow as their eyes.   **Fly-Bedecked Shapechangers.** Bouda lurk on society’s fringes, shapechanging to blend in with mortals. They seek out happy families, consuming the children in the night and leaving gruesome trophies behind. They may mark a victim nights before attacking to terrify the helpless parents.   **Gluttons.** Bouda have a weakness: they are incorrigible gluttons. When presented with a fresh corpse, even in combat, they will attempt to gorge on it or at least defile it for later consumption. Bouda are vindictive, seeking revenge on anything that drives them from a kill.</description>

    <text>A broodiken cannot speak with its creator telepathically, but it feels strong emotions and recognizes the objects of those emotions. A creator can telepathically order broodiken to hunt for and attack individuals by sending the broodiken an image of the creature and the appropriate emotion.

  <description>_Tiny and built like a caricature of a person, this creature’s enlarged head is filled with pointed teeth._   **Bodily Children.** Broodikens are crude servants created by humanoid spellcasters willing to grow them within their own bodies. They resemble their creators in the most obvious ways, with the same number of limbs and basic features, but all broodikens stand one foot tall with overly large heads and heavily fanged mouths. Those born to monstrous humanoids with wings or horns have ineffective, decorative versions that do not help the creature fly or fight.   **Emotional Echoes.** Broodikens have little personality of their own and respond to their creators’ emotions, growling when their creators feel anger and babbling happily when their creators feel joy. When their creators are more than 100 feet away, they cry loudly with a sound that resembles children of the creator’s own species. If discovered crying by anyone other than their creator, they attack. When their creators focus their anger on specific individuals, the broodikens attack as a group, using Stealth to get close and overwhelm single opponents.   **Born With Daggers.** Broodikens are created by eating the heart of a dead broodiken. Once this “seed” is consumed, 2d4 broodikens grow inside of the “mother” or creator. Nurturing the growing brood requires consuming specific muds, ashes, and plants, which cost 50 gp/day for each incubating broodiken. The incubation period requires one month and takes a toll on the creator’s health. During this time, the creator becomes fatigued after four hours without eight hours’ rest.   If the creator is not a spellcaster, a spellcaster who meets the requirements below must supervise the incubation and birth. Most spellcasters birth the broodiken using a dagger before the broodiken tears its way out. A “mother” can only control one brood of broodiken at a time. Incubating a second brood makes the first brood furiously jealous, and it will turn on its own creator.   **Constructed Nature.** A broodiken doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Their small size makes them easy to overlook.   **Treasure Finders.** Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.   **Bat Friends.** Buccas often train bats as mounts, messengers, and guard animals.

  <description>_Unleashing a bone-shattering roar, this toad-like monster bears two gnarled horns and wicked claws. It charges from its watery lair on six legs, eager for the kill._   **Pond Lurkers.** The placid surfaces of forest lakes and ponds hide many lethal threats, among them the bukavac. While not amphibious, the creature can hold its breath for minutes at a time as it lurks under the surface in wait for fresh meat.   **Enormous Roar.** A ravenous bukavac lives to hunt and devour prey, preferring intelligent prey to animals, and usually ambushes its victims. Due to its size, the beast must find deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it can flatten itself comfortably to rest in two feet of water. It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim’s struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad’s croak and lion’s roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers. If a bukavac’s devastating sonic attack routs its foes, it picks off remaining stragglers; otherwise, it retreats to its underwater hiding spot.   **Clamorous Mating.** Solitary hunters by nature, bukavacs pair up briefly in the spring. Male bukavacs travel to a female’s lair and demonstrate their prowess by unleashing their most powerful bellows. Villages ten miles away from the lair often hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don’t attack. Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years, during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.   A bukavac is 11 feet long, including its foot-long horns, stands four feet tall, and weighs 4,000 lb. The creature has a natural lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which considerably shorten its life expectancy.</description>

These are said to be angelic seals or wardings, each different. The hide of every buraq is white, though their beards, lashes, manes, and tails vary from silver and dusty tan to deep brown or glossy black.   **Heavenly Steeds.** A buraq is smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey, though their carrying capacity belies their size and apparent strength. Nevertheless, a buraq is the ultimate courier and a heavenly steed. Paladins and good-aligned clerics are the most likely candidates to ride a buraq, but other virtuous characters have had this privilege.</description>

  <description>_These light brown, furred creatures inquisitively survey their surroundings, each comforted by the presence of the others._   **Friendly Farmers.** Burrowlings work together at every task: digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptiles—and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.   **Safe Warrens.** Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.   **Die of Loneliness.** If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.   Burrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year.</description>

  <description>_Rootlike tendrils explode from the sand at the base of this tall cactus bristling with needles. It uses its tendrils to reach for prey._   **Needled Sentients.** Cactids are semi-sentient cacti that grow in a myriad of shapes and sizes, from ground-hugging barrels and spheroid clumps that pin their victims to the ground to towering saguaros with clublike arms that yank victims off their feet. Most cactids are green or brown with distinct ribs; all are lined with countless needles.   **Drain Fluids.** In addition to gathering water, a cactid's tendril-roots can snag nearby creatures and pull them into a deadly embrace. Once a creature is pinned, the cactid’s spines siphon off the victim’s bodily fluids, until little but a dried husk remains. Many cactids are adorned with bright flowers or succulent fruit to lure prey into reach. Some scatter shiny objects within reach to attract sentient creatures. For those traveling the desert, however, a cactid’s greatest treasure is the water stored within its flesh. A slain cactid’s body yields four gallons of water with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Failure indicates that only one gallon is recovered.   **Slow Packs.** Cactids were created by a nomadic sect of druids, but their original purpose is lost. They have limited mobility, so they often congregate in stands or to travel together in a pack to better hunting grounds.</description>

  <description>_Unfolding impossibly from beneath voluminous robes, this creature’s pockmarked, spindly arms end in clusters of narrow spikes. Its long, hollow, needle-like fingers and its many-jointed arms move with surprising speed and strength for such an emaciated creature._   **Hunched and Robed.** The cambium skulks through mortal society, hunched and contorted, concealing its nine-foot height and its supernumerary arms.   **Devours Bodily Humors.** The source of a cambium’s interest lies in every mortal body: the four humors, which it drains in precise amounts, sometimes to fix its own imbalances, sometimes to concoct serums meant for sale in hellish markets. Its victims are left in a desperate state, eager for a corrective fix and willing to obey the cambium’s every whim as servants and toadies.   **Abandons Victims.** After a sufficient crop has been harvested, the cambium abandons these addicts to die slowly from violent withdrawals, and allows the local population to lie fallow for a decade or so.</description>

  <description>_The beetles wore golden bridles and carried huge leather sacks of stone and guano. They marched without stopping; dozens, even hundreds, bringing fresh earth to the white-fungus trees of the great forests. Their claws skittered with a sound like horseshoes slipping on stone, but their multiple legs ensured they never fell. The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint of acid._   **Beasts of Burden and War.** Carrion beetles are powerful beasts of burden with strong jaws and the ability to both climb and burrow. With a wide back, serrated, spiky forelegs, and a narrow head, the carrion beetle is too large to ride on very comfortably although it makes an excellent platform for ballistae and howdahs. Its thick exoskeleton varies from drab brown, tan, and black to shimmering blue green, purple-green, and a highly prized yellow‑orange.   The largest carrion beetles make a distinctive wheezing sound when their spiracles are stressed; this noise creates a hum when multiple beetles run or charge on the field of battle. War beetles are often armored with protective strips of metal or chitinous armor fused to their exoskeletons, increasing their natural armor by +2 while reducing their speed to 20 feet.   **Devour Fungi and Carrion.** Carrion beetles rarely gather in groups larger than a breeding pair and a small cluster of offspring in the wild. The domesticated varieties travel in herds of 20-40 to feed on fungal forests, scavenge battlefields, or devour cave lichen and scour sewage pits. The larger caravan beetles are always antagonistic.   When breeding season hits, carrion beetles feast on the bodies of large animals. They are often found in symbiotic relationships with deathcap mycolids, darakhul, and related species. Many species in the deep underworld consider carrion beetles food and use their exoskeletons to fashion shields and armor (though their chitin is too brittle for weaponry).   Purple worms are their major predators. Worms swallow entire caravans when they find the beetles within.   **Domesticated by Ghouls.** Domesticated by the darakhul, the carrion beetles live a more complex life. They begin as simple pack animals, with the strongest being trained as war beetles. War beetles often carry ballistae and harpoons fitted with lines for use against flying foes.   In late life, the beetles are used as excavators, scouring out tunnels with their acid. After death, their exoskeletons are used both as animated scouting vehicles (ghouls hide within the shell to approach hostile territory) and as armored undead platforms packed with archers and spellcasters.</description>

  <description>_These patches of tangled, lacy moss cling to the ceiling, slowly pulsing with an eerie glow. Their stems gently writhe among the soft, feathery mass, dusting the ground below with a twinkling of phosphorescent spores._   **Plant Carnivore.** Cavelight moss glows with a pale yellow light, but when agitated, its light changes to an icy blue. Cavelight moss is frequently mistaken for a benign organism, but it hunts living flesh and renders its meals immobile before starting the long process of digestion.   A cavelight moss is a collective of smaller life forms patched together and sharing sensations. Barely cognitive, a cavelight moss spends its time positioning itself above well-traveled sections of cavern, feeding on rats, bats, and crawling insects. When it senses larger prey, it slowly and quietly moves toward the creature.   **Long-Lived Spores.** A cavelight moss can survive for 200 years, shedding luminous spores and consuming vermin. Its spores germinate in the carcasses of its victims, and in lean times, these spores can grow, albeit slowly, on guano or other areas rich in moisture and organic nutrients.   **Rare Colonies.** If a cave system has no true protectors and food is plentiful, these creatures congregate—most commonly, in bat colonies of millions of individuals. When they gather this way, cavelight mosses function as a large colony, covering strategic locations where prey roams. When a source of food moves on, the entire colony slowly disperses as well.</description>

    <text>the chelicerae is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The chelicerae has the following wizard spells prepared:

cantrips: acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion, true strike

1st level: burning hands, detect magic, expeditious retreat, ray of sickness

2nd level: hold person, invisibility, scorching ray

  <trait>
    <name>Siphon Spell Slots</name>
    <text>The chelicerae cannot replenish its spells naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell. The chelicerae can also draw power from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. It can reduce a grappled creature's Wisdom by 1d4, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point lowered. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom is unconscious until it regains at least one point, and can't offer any more power. A creature regains all lost Wisdom when it finishes a long rest.</text>

  <description>_A chelicerae resembles a massive spider perched on tall, stilted legs. Most often, the disheveled body of a robed arcanist swings from its clenched mandibles._   **Feed on Spellcasters.** These massive arachnids are largely confined to the great forests and occasional wastelands, although rumors do persist of sightings in the dark alleys of magocratic cities, causing trepidation among the spellcasters there. Few creatures pose such a threat to spellcasters as chelicerae.   **Carry Their Prey.** Walking on high, stilted legs, these creatures resemble gigantic harvesters. More often than not, they are found with the grisly bodies of humanoids dangling from the chelicerae’s clenched mandibles.   **Cocoon Arcanists.** Chelicerae stalk isolated victims, striking them with a poisonous bite and then pinning its prey within its jaws. There, their helpless body can hang for days on end as the chelicerae pursues obscure and eldritch tasks. At best, victims wake up weeks later with no memory of the events, far from home, and drained of vitality and spells. Others are stored immobilized in a thick cocoon in a high treetop until their body and mind recover. A few unlucky victims are slain and animated as walking dead to protect the chelicerae.</description>

  <description>_These scaly creatures resemble nothing so much as tiny, batwinged dragonkin._   **Dragon Sprites.** Chernomoi (which means “lair sprite” in Draconic) often reside discreetly in a dragon lair or dragonborn household, cleaning and tidying up at night, and only occasionally keeping a small trinket or shiny gemstone as compensation. They appear as tiny, winged dragonkin, dressed in metallic armor made of small coins and semi-precious stones.   **Lair Alarms.** Chernomoi are terrified of wyverns and never lair anywhere near them. Otherwise, they are very protective of their draconic masters and raise an alarm if an intruder is undetected. They fight with their tiny blades and Shriek attack if cornered, though they always flee from danger as a first option— usually straight to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.</description>

They grow in deep briar patches in forest clearings or along sunny hillsides and riverbanks. More rarely, they spawn when a sorcerer or magical creature’s blood is spilled on the forest floor, or when summoned into being by obscure druidic items of power.   **Thorn Fortresses.** Despite their size, children of the briar gather in great numbers, cultivating ancient forest thickets into veritable fortresses. Wise men flee when they hear their clicking language in the underbrush, for the children have all the capricious wickedness of spiteful children and a taste for blood.   **Spies and Scouts.** From their lairs, the children of the briar creep far and wide to spy on the forest’s inhabitants, sometimes using spiders, monstrous centipedes, and giant dragonflies as mounts. They converse with travelers bearing interesting news, but their words are thorned with gleeful malice, jealous bile, and lies. They are not above murder. They trade news and gossip for trinkets, favors, and drops of spilled blood.   The fey have long used the children of the briar as spies and informants, and the power of the Otherworld now courses through their veins, allowing them to work simple magical tricks and slip between the mortal and faerie realms with relative ease.</description>

  <description>_A chronalmental is difficult to pin down, and it may appear as a large man-shaped absence in the air that reveals first a field of stars, then a contorted rainbow of colored bands, then a brilliant white light, strobing in and out of existence._   **Fluid as Time.** Shifting between the past, present, and future, chronalmentals are formed from temporal energy. They flow like sand in an hourglass and exist between the tickings of a clock.   The first chronalmentals were forged from extra time left over from the beginning of the universe. Many served as shock troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or abandoned to drift aimlessly in the Astral Plane or in the void between the stars.   **Stewards of Calamity.** Locations of historical significance— both past and future—attract chronalmentals. They have a fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.   **Environmental Chaos.** Whatever the terrain, the environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental. Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments. These changes occur randomly, a side-effect of a chronalmental’s presence, and things return to normal when they depart.   **Elemental Nature.** A chronalmental does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_The cikavak is a remarkably ugly magical bird—a supernatural creature conjured through a lengthy ritual. A dark gray comb flops atop their heads and shapeless wattles dangle from their throats. They seem unimposing._   **Dagger Beaks.** Cikavaks use their elongated, dull-gray beaks to draw up nectar and other fluids—or to stab with the force of a dagger. Although it requires great effort to call up these homely birds, the magic is surprisingly common, known among peasants and townsfolk as well as mages. Once summoned, they remain faithful to their masters until death. While cikavaks don’t speak, they comprehend the Common tongue and can speak with animals to help their master. They often magically silence the cries of more melodious birds.   **Potion Pouches.** Cikavaks possess another odd ability: when fully distended, their ventral pouches hold up to half a gallon of almost any liquid. These resilient pouches take little or no damage from their contents, holding potions without ingesting them or even carrying acid without injury.   Thieves make use of this ability, directing the birds to siphon up liquids and thus steal honey from neighbors’ beehives, as well as milk, beer, and wine. The most audacious thieves send their birds into magicians’ towers, alchemists’ shops, or the local apothecary to seize mercury, phlogiston, and more exotic substances. They carry these stolen fluids back to their owner in their pouches. While normally strong flyers, when laden with liquids, their flight is clumsy at best.   **Folk Conjuration.** To call a cikavak with folk magic rituals, a character must gather an egg from a black hen as well as 30 gp worth of herbs and colored chalks. Cast at sunset, the folk ritual requires half an hour and requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to succeed. (The material components can be used multiple times, until the ritual succeeds). The hen’s egg must then be carried and kept warm for 40 days. During this time, the ritual caster must not bathe or be subject to any spell effects. Usable only by non-casters, the ritual’s feeble magic is immediately dispelled if the cikavak’s master uses any other sort of spell or spell-like ability.</description>

  <description>_At rest, a clockwork abomination resembles a pile of debris and scrap on the ground, but in motion it reveals a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many orange‑yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of expression or intent._   **Bound Devils.** Clockwork abominations result from ill‑considered attempts to bind lesser devils into clockwork or steam-driven constructs. The disciplines of devil binding and engineering seemingly do not mix well, and the results of such attempts are typically disastrous. Every now and then, however, something goes right, and a clockwork abomination is created.   **Junk Collectors.** Clockwork abominations are canny enough to collect bits of old wagons, tools, or machinery as camouflage. Motionless among such objects, they can often surprise a foe.   **Sadistic Machines.** Malevolent in the extreme, these fiendish automatons are frustrated by the limits of their new forms, and they delight in inflicting suffering on others. Constantly seeking to break free of their creators’ control, the most they can be entrusted to do is to serve as a guardian or attack something.   **Constructed Nature.** A clockwork abomination doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Gleaming metal and whirring gears make up the form of this elaborate mechanical insect the size of a housecat._   **Bejeweled Familiars.** Forged by talented jewelers and sold to gear-mages and aristocrats, clockwork beetles are highly prized as familiars. Although normally created in the form of metal beetles, their appearance can vary greatly. Some resemble incandescent ladybugs while others have razorsharp horns reminiscent of deadly stag beetles. Some are fashioned as darkling beetles with prehensile antennae, and even weevil-like designs have been spotted.   **Flying Noisemakers.** In the southern deserts, scarab beetle patterns are particularly prized. Anytime the creatures move they emit an audible rhythmic buzz, especially when taking to the air. Once in flight, they create a disturbing cacophony of clicks and whirs.   **Hidden Timers.** The most talented gear‑mages occasionally design a clockwork beetle with a hidden countdown clock that silently ticks down over years or even decades. When the tightly wound gear-counter expires, it suddenly triggers a mechanical metamorphosis within the beetle, causing it to rapidly transform and blossom into a completely different clockwork creature—a wondrous surprise known in advance only to the designer who created it so many years ago.   **Constructed Nature.** A clockwork beetle doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_This black, mechanical hunting dog keeps its nose to the ground sniffing and whuffling. Gleaming teeth fill its metal mouth._   **Ticking Bloodhounds.** Partners to the clockwork huntsmen, these black hounds follow the trails of criminals, escaped slaves, and other unfortunates. Their infused spirits are those of hunting hounds, and their animating magic allows them to follow a scent with preternatural speed and accuracy.   **Toy Variants.** Some claim the infusion of animal spirits into clockwork hounds was one of the great arcane discoveries that made the creation of the gearforged possible; others say that it has done nothing but make clockwork mages rich. Certainly the earliest hounds were built for work and war, but the most recent varieties also include some that are deceptively big-eyed and painted as children’s toys or to match a young aristocrat’s favorite outfit.   **Serve the Rulers.** Despite this brief flirtation with fashion, most clockwork hounds continue to serve town watches, royal huntsmen, road wardens, moneylenders, and criminal gangs as loyal trackers and guards.   **Constructed Nature.** A clockwork hound doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A clockwork huntsman is mechanical soldier clad in flat-black armor, and beneath its breastplate, gears tick and whir._   **Slave Hunters.** These metal huntsmen were once the province of corrupt aristocrats, running down escaped slaves and tracking prey in hunting expeditions. Their masters may vary, but the clockwork huntsmen still perform when called upon. In some places they operate only on the command of the secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted for questioning.   Huntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their quarry as a small group of two or three. Because they are unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them for long without magical assistance.   **Despised Machines.** Clockwork huntsmen are painted matte black with mithral trim, and occasionally outfitted with armor or a black steel blade for added intimidation. Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and commanders shun them.   **Obedient to Orders.** Bound with specific instructions, clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, always alert to their surroundings. Clockwork huntsmen are unrelenting and single-minded in their missions, focusing on particular targets—priests, spellcasters, or heavily armored intruders, as directed. Oblivious to injury, clockwork huntsmen attack until destroyed or ordered to stand down.   Clockwork huntsmen stand nearly six feet tall and weigh 400 lb.   **Constructed Nature.** A clockwork huntsman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

They are much too valuable to undertake patrols or menial labor, and they are unleashed only for dangerous situations that clockwork watchmen cannot handle.   _**Single Targets.**_ A clockwork myrmidon defends itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon is unrelenting and single-minded, and it attacks one particular target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated.   Unless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.   _**Alchemical Tricks.**_ A clockwork myrmidon is always outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.   _**Constructed Nature.**_ A clockwork myrmidon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_This mechanical being’s body is composed of brass and iron and bedecked in a loose uniform of the city watch. Its movements are slow but steady._   **Lightly Armored Servants.** Clockwork watchmen are more solidly built versions of the more common clockwork scullions (servant creatures in wealthy households, incapable of combat). Proper clockwork watchmen are built with iron parts instead of tin, and given keener senses. Many have small bits of armor covering their joints and most vital parts.   **Constant Rounds.** They endlessly patrol the city day and night, pausing only to receive maintenance and new boots.   **Shouts and Stutters.** Their speech is slow and halting, but their distinctive shouts and whistles bring human guards at a run.   **Constructed Nature.** A clockwork watchman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>This clockwork creature looks like a mechanical spider with long, spindly legs, including one equipped with a particularly sharp blade that’s disproportionately large for the creature’s body.   _**Cloth Makers.**_ These tiny but useful devices are a boon to weavers as they help produce clothing—and they also sometimes serve as spies and defenders, for nothing is so invisible as a simple machine making cloth, day in and day out. As their name implies, these devices resemble large spiders but with ten limbs instead of eight. Two of their legs are equipped with loops or crooks useful in guiding thread on a loom, six are for moving and climbing, one is for stitching and extremely fast needlework, and one has a razor-sharp blade used to trim thread or cloth (or for attacking foes).   _**Throw Poison.**_ Weaving spiders rarely initiate combat unless directed to by their owners, but they instinctively defend themselves, their masters, and other weavers. A weaving spider throws its poisoned shuttle at the nearest foe, then climbs along the strand to attack that foe. Weaving spiders fight until destroyed or ordered to stand down. When spying, they flee as soon as they are threatened, to preserve whatever information they have gathered.   _**Constructed Nature.**_ A clockwork weaving spider doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Around a corner in the wine cellar stumbles a surly, two-foot tall man carrying an open bottle of wine. He has a bushy beard and wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and kneelength red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine._   **Drunks in the Cellar.** Clurichauns are mean-spirited, alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks.   However, if the clurichaun’s host keeps him or her well supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her alone, the clurichaun will protect their wine cellars from thieves, drunkards, or worse—becoming quite vigorous when they feel the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a particular hatred for Open Game License</description>

  <description>_The paving stones underfoot suddenly lurch and tumble over one another. Thousands of tiny limbs, pincers, and stingers break from the stony surface and frantically scuttle forward._   A cobbleswarm is made up of tiny, crablike creatures with smooth, stony shells. Individually they are referred to as cobbles. The creatures vary in size, shape, and color, but all have six segmented legs, a whiplike stinger, and a single eye.   **Paving Stone Mimics.** When the eye is closed and the limbs are pulled under the shell, cobbles are nearly indistinguishable from lifeless paving stones. Victims of cobbleswarms are caught unaware when the floor beneath them suddenly writhes and shifts, and dozens of eyes appear where there should be none.   **Trap Affinity.** Cobbleswarms have a rudimentary understanding of traps. They often hide in places where their shift and tumble ability can slide intruders into pits or across trapped areas, and kobold tribes prize them highly for this reason.</description>

  <description>_A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light._   **Unnatural Aura.** Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a deathwisp, unless a master makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.   **Fey Undead.** A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.   **Rift Walkers.** Many deathwisps remain among the shadows, but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates, or by walking along shadow roads between the worlds. Retaining only a trace of their former personality and knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.   **Devour Breath.** A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living things, and invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against greater numbers.   **Undead Nature.** A deathwisp doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep</description>

Rippling distortion obscures the creature’s body, which is roughly the size and shape of an adult human.   _**Demonic Messengers.**_ Malakbel demons are contradictory creatures. They are both messengers and destroyers who carry the words of demon lords or even dark gods to the mortal realm. Paradoxically, once their message is delivered, they often leave none of its hearers alive to spread the tale.   _**Where Virtue Cannot Look.**_ The malakbel is the embodiment of all that is forbidden and destructive. Despite its vital role as a messenger, its destructive nature always comes to the fore. A malakbel descends upon settlements and travelers with the merciless and relentless onslaught of the raging sun, burning all it sees to cinders before vanishing like heat shimmers at dusk.</description>

The target is knocked 20 feet back and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. The target's shadow stays in the space the target was originally in, and acts as an undead shadow under the command of the psoglav demon. If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before the undead shadow fades and the creature's natural shadow returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that case, the creature's alignment shifts to evil and it falls under the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain. A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit.</text>

  <description>_Resembling a black-furred stag that walks like a man, this creature has a pair of immense, branching antlers arching above its coldly gleaming eyes. The fur is sleek over most of its body, but becomes shaggy around its goatlike legs. The creature’s hands are tipped with wicked claws, and its legs are goatlike with cloven hooves._   _**Assume Mortal Form.**_ Rubezahls are capricious creatures, driven by constantly shifting motivations and mannerisms. They are consummate tricksters who delight in taking the form of innocuous mortals like travelling monks, tinkers, or lost merchants. They love to play the friend with their nearly undetectable lies, slipping into the confidence of unsuspecting mortals before murdering them.   _**Counting Demons.**_ Rubezahls have a weakness, however. They are known as counting demons, and a savvy mortal who knows its nature can confound one with groups of objects: a handful of coins, a basket of apples, even a bed of flowers. If the objects are clearly pointed out to the rubezahl, the creature becomes distracted until it counts each item in the group. Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast; even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments for a rubezahl to assess. Rubezahl loathe being compelled this way, and they are equally driven to annihilate any mortal bold enough to exploit this weakness.</description>

    <name>Summon Bat Swarm</name>
    <text>The high-frequency cries of a skin bat attract nearby mundane bats. When a skin bat faces danger, 0-3 (1d4 - 1) swarms of bats arrive within 1d6 rounds. These swarms are not under the skin bat's command, but they tend to reflexively attack whatever the skin bat is fighting.</text>

The skin bat can't bite a different creature while it's attached, and its bite attack automatically hits a creature the skin bat is attached to. Removing a skin bat requires a successful DC 11 Strength check and inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage to the creature the bat is being removed from. A successful save renders the target immune to skin bat poison for 24 hours.</text>

  <description>_A repulsive, batlike creature darts from the Stygian darkness. Its body consists entirely of rotting sheets of stolen skin. Though its large eyes are glassy and lifeless, an unmistakably evil intent glimmers within them as a toothless mouth spreads wide in hunger._   Skin bats are undead creatures created from skin flayed from the victims of sacrificial rites. They are given a measure of unlife by a vile ritual involving immersion in Abyssal flesh vats and invocations to the relevant demon lords. They feed on the skin of living beings to replenish their own constantly rotting skin. Their acidic saliva acts as a paralytic poison and leaves ugly scars on those who survive an attack.   **Cliff and Dungeon Dwellers.** Skin bats prey on the unwary but do not develop sinister plots of their own. Their flocks can be encountered in isolated areas accessible only by flight or by climbing treacherous cliffs. Skin bats can exist in any climate. In cool climes, they feed only infrequently, because the cold preserves their forms and reduces the need to replenish decaying flesh. This also explains why they are attracted to the dark depths of ageless dungeons. In wet, tropical climes where their skin decomposes rapidly, skin bats are voracious feeders by necessity.   **Accidental Treasures.** Skin bats have no use for magic items or wealth, but occasionally a ring or necklace from a past victim gets embedded in their fleshy folds, where it becomes an unintended trophy.   The typical skin bat has an 8-foot wingspan. The color of their skin matches that of their prey, so a skin bat’s coloration can change over time. A skin bat weighs about 15 lb.   **Undead Nature.** A skin bat doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <name>Enchanted Cage</name>
    <text>The iron cage that holds the fetal savant provides cover for the creature. The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Madness</name>
    <text>A derro fetal savant's particular madness grants it immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a wish spell or comparable magic. A derro fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Vulnerability to Sunlight</name>
    <text>A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1/day spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.</text>
  </trait>
  <action>
    <name>Babble</name>
    <text>The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant's babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.</text>
  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Soul Exchange</name>
    <text>As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_This creature resembles a blue-skinned dwarven infant, no older than a year. Its limbs flail and its head lolls with an obvious lack of coordination, and it screams incessantly._   Of the madness and insanity that resonates so strongly in derro society, perhaps none is so twisted as these premature infants, born insane and destined to lead their people further into madness. These derro are known as fetal savants.   **Soul Swapping.** Only the rarest of derro are born with the ability to exchange souls with other creatures, and when discovered, the babbling infants are treated with maddened reverence.   **Carried into Battle.** Placed in small, intricately wrought pillowed cages and borne aloft on hooked golden staves, the wild-eyed newborns are used to sow madness and confusion among enemy ranks.   **Fear the Sun.** Fetal savants hate and fear all bright lights.</description>

They embrace the powers of darkness and channel shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.   **Herald of Madness.** The derro shadow antipaladin is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins, these unhinged creatures aren’t swaggering warriors encased in steel or their dark reflections. Instead, a shadow antipaladin serves as a more subtle vector for the madness of its patron. They are masters of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith of those who believe that goodness can survive the approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin’s wake.</description>

    <text>Ia'Affrat's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). Ia'Affrat can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

    <name>Inhabit</name>
    <text>Ia'Affrat can enter the body of an incapacitated or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. If Ia'Affrat inhabits a dead body, it can animate it and control its movements, effectively becoming a zombie for as long as it remains inside. Ia'Affrat can abandon the body as an action. Attacks against the host deal half damage to Ia'Affrat as well, but Ia'Affrat's resistances and immunities still apply against this damage. In a living victim, Ia'Affrat can control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster (save DC 19) on the victim. Ia'Affrat can consume a living victim; the target takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage per hour while Ia'Affrat inhabits its body, and Ia'Affrat regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. When inhabiting a body, Ia'Affrat can choose to have any spell it casts with a range of self, target the inhabited body rather than itself. The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia'Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia'Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer's passive Insight. A greater restoration spell or comparable magic forces Ia'Affrat to abandon the host.</text>

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it traveled. If the target collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</text>

  <description>_A nightmare wrapped in chains and built of cutting cogs and whirring gears, an automata devil howls like a hurricane in battle. Once chain devils, automata devils have been promoted to greater power._   **Guards and Overseers.** Sometimes called castigas, automata devils are made to monitor others. They are often put in charge of prisoners or infernal factories.   **Pierced by Chain and Wire.** This slender creature’s skin is pierced with barbs, sharp nails, and coils of wire, which have been threaded through its flesh. Chains are buried under blisters and scabs. This infernal horror’s eyelids—both front and back pairs—have been sewn back with wire, while six arms ending in large grasping hands erupt from its shoulders.   **Coiled Metal Whips.** The creature’s back is broad and massive. Its head is a black mass ending in two large mandibles. By its side, it carries a huge coiled whip that squirms like a snake and is said to scent lies and treachery. The creature’s stomach opens up like a second mouth, filled with spines.</description>

  <description>_Small horns crown this pig-faced devil’s head. It stands on shaggy goat legs and holds a flaming polearm in its clawed hands. It bears a wicked gleam in its black eyes._   **Bad Bargains.** Quick and canny, a chort devil uses varied, pleasing forms to entice mortals to make terrible bargains, but it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim weren’t so desperate, he wouldn’t be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.   **Recitation of Contracts.** An annual spectacle in large cities involves some poor fool who believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a love who once spurned him, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim’s affairs are present to hear it, and it disappears once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.   **Smear Tactics.** A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin’s sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.</description>

    <text>As a bonus action, a gilded devil wearing jewelry worth at least 1,000 gp can reshape it into a +2 heavy flail. A creature struck by this jeweled flail suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws until his or her next short rest, in addition to normal weapon damage. The flail reverts to its base components 1 minute after it leaves the devil's grasp, or upon the gilded devil's death.</text>

    <name>Voracious Greed</name>
    <text>As an action, a gilded devil can consume nonmagical jewelry or coinage worth up to 1,000 gp. For each 200 gp consumed, it heals 5 hp of damage. A gilded devil can use this ability against the worn items of a grappled foe. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to keep an item from being consumed.</text>

  <description>_This tall, bronze-complexioned man is abnormally long-limbed and clad in armor of stained and battered coins. His wiry frame is festooned with mismatched bracelets, rings, and necklaces, each gaudier than the last. The easy smile on his face is cold with envy._   **Servants of Mammon.** Rarely seen in their natural form outside of Hell, gilded devils are the servitors of Mammon, archdevil of greed. They tempt and corrupt with promises of wealth, power, and fame, twisting mortal greed into sure damnation.   **Impression of Wisdom.** When pursuing a mortal of high standing, gilded devils prefer unassuming appearances, molding their flesh and gaudy trappings to make themselves look the parts of wise advisers, canny merchants, or sly confidants.   **Fond of Gold and Jewels.** Even in their humblest form, gilded devils always wear a piece of golden jewelry or a jeweled button or ornament.</description>

    <text>An ink devil can corrupt the magic within any scroll by touch. Any such corrupted scroll requires a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw to use successfully.

  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Devil's Mark</name>
    <text>Ink devils can flick ink from their fingertips at a single target within 15 feet of the devil. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13), or the affected creature gains a devil's mark—a black, red, or purple tattoo in the shape of an archduke's personal seal (most often Mammon or Totivillus but sometimes Arbeyach, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Dispater, or others). All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_This small devil wears a small red hat. A wicked grin flashes black teeth, and the creature nervously wrings its hands, baring long, needle-like claws._   Ink devils have small, pursed mouths and long, thin, bony fingers. Their nails resemble quills. Their heads are often bald or shaved in a monastic tonsure, and they have two small horns, no larger than an acorn. Their skin tends toward walnut, indigo, and black tones, though the eldest are as pale as parchment. They often wear robes and carry scroll cases, and many consider Titivillus the greatest of arch-devils.   **Cowards at Heart.** Ink devils are talkers and cowards. They prefer chatting, whining, and pleading to any form of combat. When they are forced to fight, they prefer to hide behind other devils. They force lesser devils, like lemures, to fight for them while they use teleportation, invisibility, and their ability to disrupt the concentration of spellcasters to harry the opposition.   **False Gifts.** They often give strangers false gifts, like letters of credit, charters, or scholarly papers inscribed with a glyph of warding to start combat.   **Bibliophiles and Bookworms.** Ink devils live in libraries and scriptoria in the hells and related planes. Their speed and keen vision make them excellent accountants, record keepers, translators, and note takers. They cannot be trusted, and they delight in altering documents for their own amusement or in their master’s service.</description>

While poisoned this way, the target takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, from liquefaction of its innards. A successful save renders the target immune to the koralk's poison for 24 hours. If a creature dies while poisoned by a koralk, its body bursts open, spewing vile liquid and a newly-formed lemure devil. The lemure is under the command of any higher-order devil nearby. The poison can be neutralized by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or comparable magic. If the lemure is killed, the original creature can be restored to life by resurrection or comparable magic.</text>

  <description>_The fiendish hulk bears features taken from a nightmare scorpion, with three stinging tails and four limbs, and wields a massive scythe._   _**Transforming Poison.**_ Poison from any one of the koralk’s three stingers liquefies the target’s insides in an agonizing transformation. The stung creature swells as its organs, muscle, and skeleton rapidly break down and reform. When the skin casing pops, it releases a spray of gelatinous goo and reveals the form of a lemure, the lowest form of devil. The new lemure is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from that moment on is the same as any lemure’s. Eventually it will be remolded into a higher form of devil and become another warrior in service to the arch-devils. Astoundingly, the koralk’s poison can even work this transformation on demons, converting them to the lowest form of devil.   _**Infernal Mounts.**_ A koralk is large and strong enough for Medium-size devils to ride as a mount. They don’t like being used this way, but being devils, they do what they’re told by their betters or suffer the consequences.</description>

  <description>_A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror painted in mist and moonlight._   **Corruptors of the Moon.** Always standing a bit apart from the machinations of the Dukes of Hell due to their dependence on moonlight, lunar devils can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werewolves. They are a lazy breed of devil, and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over any more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers, pitting them against followers of sun gods.   **Vain and Boastful.** Lunar devils are as vain as they are indolent, and tales the fey tell of them involve thwarting them by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils frequently befriend the dark fey.   **Flying in Darkness.** In combat, lunar devils sometimes cast fly on allies to bring them along, and they stay in areas of moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils have excellent vision in total darkness as well, though, and are happy to use that against foes. At range, they use hurl moonlight and lightwalking to frustrate enemies. In melee, they use wall of ice to split foes, the better to battle just half at a time.</description>

  <description>_Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with well‑chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and hoofed feet._   The orobas thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who have the coin (or other form of payment). The common phrase, “never trust a gift horse,” stems from these corrupting devils.   **Horse-Headed but Wise.** When called to the mortal world, they sometimes take the shape of a destrier. Orobas devils prefer to take the horrific form of a horse-headed man. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils and their fingers sport ragged claws. This beast‑like appearance belies their true strength; the orobas possess an uncanny knowledge of the past, as well as of things to come.   **Masters of Deceit.** When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfully—or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile. Practitioners of the dark arts know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else, and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.   **Surrounded by Lessers.** Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of their immediate future.</description>

They can also fight with saltencrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.   **Servants of Mammon.** Salt devils claim to serve Mammon, and they often ally with gnolls and slavers with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites or just to poison the water.   **Slavers and Corruptors.** Salt devils create slave markets and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those indentured into their service. They detest summoning peers during combat because they hate being indebted to another devil. They prefer to forge alliances with mortals when partners are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and greedy than one might expect of Mammon’s servants, preferring to encourage corruption in others.</description>

  <description>_This lumbering saurian quadruped has large, oblong plates of bone covered in greenish slime protruding from its back and its thick, club-like tail._   _**Large Plates.**_ People describe this reptilian herbivore as “the animal with planks growing out of its back.” The mbielu is a large dinosaur akin to a stegosaurus, with square dorsal plates that support symbiotic colonies of toxic, green algae. The plates themselves are as large as shields.   _**Aquatic Herbivore.**_ An mbielu spends most of its life underwater, feeding on aquatic plants and avoiding the withering glare of the harsh sun, but it comes onto land frequently to sun itself for a few hours before immersing itself once again.   _**Toxic Alchemy.**_ Its dorsal plate algae undergo an alchemical reaction in the continual transition between water and sky, especially during mbielu migrations to new watery dens. The algae produce a hallucinogenic contact poison that clouds the minds of most creatures. Mbielus themselves are immune to the toxin.</description>

  <description>_This ill-tempered, six-horned creature resembles a triceratops the size of an ox, with pairs of horns atop its nose and brows, as well as great tusks jutting from each side of its mouth._   _**Hatred of Elephants.**_ Ngobous are ox-sized dinosaurs often at war with elephants over territory. Ngobous are irascible and suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of elephants’ scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou’s rage.   _**Poor Beasts of War.**_ Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on the ill-tempered animals; their behavior is too erratic, especially if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.   _**Trample Crops.**_ Ngobou herds can smash entire crops flat in minutes—and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or cattle in little time as well.</description>

  <description>_Except for a pair of tiny fangs, the entire body of this yellowishgreen worm looks like a ropy tangle of slime-covered tubes and puddles of mucus._   **Anesthetic Ooze.** Many jungle clans believe the dipsa is an eyeless snake, but it is a tubular ooze with a lethal poisonous bite. The dipsa’s venom has an anesthetic quality that allows the ooze to cling to creatures and slowly turn their innards to jelly without being noticed until the victim falls down dead. Once the poison’s numbing property wears off, however, victims report an agonizing sense of burning from the inside out.   **Tiny Fangs.** A dipsa’s undulating movement evokes that of a snake as much as its serpentine form, but close examination reveals that it has neither bones nor internal organs, only tiny fangs of the same color and substance as the rest of its body. A dipsa never exceeds 1 foot in length. Its coloration oscillates between sickly hues of yellow or green.   **Gelatinous Eggs.** Dipsas are hermaphroditic. When two dipsas breed, they leave behind about 100 gelatinous eggs in a small puddle of highly acidic milt. A dozen become fertilized and survive long enough to hatch, after which they immediately devour the others.</description>

  <description>_This twisted humanoid has gray flesh and black claws that drip blood. A bone mask is bound to its head by strips of putrid flesh and a third arm hangs from the right side of the creature’s body, its hand clutching a large sack stained with blood._   **Plague Bringers.** Dissimortuum are undead monstrosities constructed by necromancers to spread the undead plague, slowly but surely. These creatures are rare but tenacious. A dissimortuum obeys orders from the necromancer whose magic created it.   When a dissimortuum kills, it collects body parts from its victims and keeps them in a sack that it carries with its third arm at all times. The monster sets down its sack of trophies only when pressed in combat, to make the most of its extra limb.   **Constructing Dissimortuum.** Even when not following instructions, a dissimortuum seeks to create more of its own kind. The creature wanders graveyards, battlefields, and slums, searching for the gruesome components it needs to construct a mask and body for its undead offspring. The process is slow, taking up to a month to make a single mask, but a dissimortuum has nothing but time. The new creation is independent and not under the control of its maker.   **Donning the Mask.** The mask of a dissimortuum is nigh indestructible. When the creature is destroyed, its mask usually survives and breaks free. On its own, the object detects as magical with mixed enchantment and necromantic auras. It is a tempting souvenir, but anyone foolish enough to don the mask is immediately wracked by pain and takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The character must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the mask. The domination arrives slowly. The character acts normally for a day or two, but then the character notices periods of time that cannot be accounted for. During these times, the character gathers the grisly components needed to build a new body for the dissimortuum. This process takes a week, after which the character is freed from domination as the undead creature is reborn.</description>

Outside the mines, dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds.   **Derro Cruelty.** Derro also use dogmoles, but such unfortunate creatures are scarred and brutalized, barely controllable even by their handlers.</description>

  <description>_The domovoi enjoy violence and bonebreaking; this makes them useful to more delicate creatures that need enforers._   **Long Armed Bruisers.** Domovoi resemble nothing so much as large, stony goblins, with oversized heads and leering grins, and with mossy beards as well as massive shoulders and forearms. Their large limbs give them reach and powerful slam attacks.   **Abandoned Servants.** The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and some were left behind—some say on purpose.   **Debt Collectors.** These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They can use alter self and invisibility at will, and they delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers. They enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.</description>

To model this, run them in groups of 4 for attack purposes and have those groups all use the same +5 to attack and do 1d4 damage.

    <name>Arcane Doubling (recharges after 10 minutes)</name>
    <text>A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.</text>

    <name>Doppeling Disease</name>
    <text>At the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.</text>

    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

- A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.

- The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon.

  <description>Covered in black spikes, the dragon’s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.   Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.   _**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.   Cave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.   _**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.   _**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.    ## A Cave Dragon’s Lair     Labyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.   Large vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.   Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour.   Cave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.   Cave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

  <description>Covered in black spikes, the dragon’s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.   Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.   _**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.   Cave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.   _**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.   _**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.    ## A Cave Dragon’s Lair     Labyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.   Large vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.   Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour.   Cave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.   Cave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. * A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom. * The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon’s lair. * Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood. * Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon’s endless and undiscriminating hunger.    If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</description>

    <name>Flame Dragon's Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can't stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.

- A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</text>

    <text>the region containing a legendary flame dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.

- Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.

- Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon's lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they're spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

if the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.</text>

  <description>_The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._   The flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.   _**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.   _**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.   _**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.   Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.    ## Flame Dragon’s Lair     Flame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.   Many of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row. * A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it.

The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common. * Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines. * Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.    If the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.</description>

  <description>_The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._   The flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.   _**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.   _**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.   _**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.   Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.    ## Flame Dragon’s Lair     Flame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.   Many of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row. * A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. * The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. * A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common. * Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines. * Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair.

  <description>_Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests when not called to settle disputes._   _**Glimmering Champions.**_ Light glints off a mithral dragon’s glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush against its body—but open like a fan to expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon’s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon’s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.   _**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard—though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.   _**Peacemakers.**_ Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these vital roles.</description>

  <description>_Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests when not called to settle disputes._   _**Glimmering Champions.**_ Light glints off a mithral dragon’s glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush against its body—but open like a fan to expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon’s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon’s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.   _**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard—though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.   _**Peacemakers.**_ Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these vital roles.</description>

    <name>Sea Dragon's Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.</text>

- Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.

- Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.

  <description>_This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._   **Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.   Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.   **Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.   **Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.    ## Sea Dragon’s Lair     Sea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.   Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.   The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained.

Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.   **Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.    ## Sea Dragon’s Lair     Sea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.   Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.   The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area. * Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water. * Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.    If the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</description>

  <description>_This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._   **Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.   Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.   **Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light.

    <name>Void Dragon's Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- The Void briefly overlaps the dragon's lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.</text>

    <text>the region containing a legendary void dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.

- Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can't create bright light in this area.

- Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.

  <description>_A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body._   **Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.   **Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.   **Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.    ## A Void Dragon’s Lair     The true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.   When a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.   If fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round. * The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge. * Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area. * Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.    If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</description>

  <description>_A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body._   **Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.   **Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.   **Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.    ## A Void Dragon’s Lair     The true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.   When a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.   If fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round. * The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.    ### Regional Effects     The region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge. * Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area. * Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.    If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</description>

    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

- Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair's wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

- A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.</text>

  <description>_Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._   Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.   _**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.   _**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.   _**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.   Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.    ## Wind Dragon’s Lair     Wind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row. * Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. * Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. * A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.</description>

  <description>_Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._   Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.   _**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.   _**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.   _**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.

  <description>_The dragon eel’s unmistakable slender form sports a powerful single finned tail and wicked jaws like a matched pair of serrated blades. Dragon eels vary widely in color from browns and blacks to brilliant iridescent hues in mottled patterns._   **Fond of Servants.** While most dragon eels are solitary and irascible, on rare instances some form pairs or small bands—and some gather humanoid servants.   **Magnetic and Lightning.** Dragon eels make their natural homes in twisting underwater cave systems and prefer magnetically-aligned, metallic cavern formations navigable with their refined electric-sight. Some dragon eels use their constant electric auras combined with acquired alchemical reagents to electroplate portions of their golden hoard onto the walls of their dwellings.   **Pirate Fleets and Dominions.** Dragon eels claim large swaths of shoreline as their demesne. Although neither particularly cruel nor righteous, a dragon eel often lords over awed tribes, allowing locals to revere it as a mighty spirit. Some dragon eels use such tribes as the core of a pirate fleet or raiding parties carried on their backs. Their ability to swim through air during storms adds to their reputation as terrible thunder spirits.   **Bribable.** Their deceptive moniker sometimes lulls foolish sailors into a false confidence when they expect to face a simple if dangerous eel beast, but instead find themselves dealing with intelligent draconic kings of the coastal shallows. Wise sailors traveling through known dragon eel territory bring tithes and offerings to placate them.</description>

  <description>_The dragon-headed leaves of these oak trees sometimes rustle despite the lack of wind, betraying a hint of their draconic power._   **Gifts among Dragons.** These magnificent trees are imbued with some characteristics of their draconic masters. While most groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.   **Silent Guardians.** Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless or allow the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once enough targets enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves at or breathe on their targets, adjusting their position to make better use of their weapons.   **Long Memories.** Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 lb, but ancient specimens can reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree’s master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a month. While this time barely registers on a dragon’s whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness.</description>

    <text>the drake's innate casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: friends, vicious mockery

5/day each: calm emotions, dissonant whispers, ray of sickness, hideous laughter

  <description>_This plump little creature reclines with a dazed look in its eyes and the suggestion of a grin on its fanged jaws._   **Scaled Barflies.** Alehouse drakes squat in busy bars, rowdy taverns, and bustling inns. A bane or savior to every bartender and innkeeper, alehouse drakes enjoy pushing patrons’ emotions, driving crowds to ecstatic cheers or bloody bar fights.   Alehouse drakes make their homes in cities and towns, though older drakes settle down in roadside coaching inns. In the former situations, they are often troublemakers or pranksters, but in the latter circumstances, they usually befriend the proprietor and help manage flared tempers and weepy drinkers in return for living space and a generous tab.   **Relentless Gossips.** Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and often trade in information, making them good sources for news about town. More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.   **Family Heirlooms.** Alehouse drakes are one to two feet long on average and weigh about eighteen lb. with a plump belly. Their scales are deep amber with cream or white highlights, and they possess glittering, light-colored eyes. The oldest recorded alehouse drake lived just past 400 years—some are quite beloved by innkeeping families, and treated bit like family heirlooms.</description>

  <description>_A lean and dull-scaled ash drake often perches on a chimney as if it just crawled out, its tail still hanging into the chimney as smoke billows out._   **Chimney Nesting.** Ash drakes clog chimney flues and delight in dusting crowds with thick, choking ash and soot, while the drakes laugh with sneering, wheezing tones. To placate the creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop and its workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them very difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the beasts and appreciate the added security they bring.   **Hunt Strays and Pets.** Ash drakes eat rats and stray animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended, possibly beloved pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake doesn’t consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature’s intensely hot and sooty breath weapon.   While an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot long tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than one might expect—approximately ten lb. Every third winter, when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find a mate. If the new couple roosts in a city or town, the nearby streets know it, as the air becomes nearly unbreathable with soot. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two years of age.   **Volcanic Haunts.** Ash drakes outside a city live in or near volcanic plateaus, and mutter about the lack of neighbors to bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or flame dragon, since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with plenty of ash.</description>

  <description>_Swimming upright, this creature peels itself from the vibrant seascape and strikes with needle-thin claws, shredding teeth, and a wickedly curved stinger._   **Camouflaged Hunter.** Like a piece of moving coral, this drake’s coloration and scale patterns change to match nearby anemones, corals, seaweed, and sea urchins. This adaptation allows the creature considerable stealth in its natural habitat. It avoids combat if it can, preferring to hide and protect its young. Long serrated spines stretch from the coral drake’s body, waving in brilliant colors against a blue sea.   **All Spikes and Needles.** The creature’s long snout stretches out from its narrow face and an array of spikes and slender protrusions form a jagged crown. Inside the mouth, serrated teeth form multiple ringed ridges where it’s young feed on leftover scraps of food and small parasites. Needle-thin talons spring from finned appendages, and a stinger frilled with tiny barbs curves at the end of its slender tail.   A coral drake measures seven feet from the tip of its snout to its barbed stinging tail. Thin and agile, the beast weighs less than 100 lb. Both male and female coral drakes gestate their delicate eggs inside sacks within their mouths and throats. This oral incubation protects the vulnerable eggs, but only a handful ever reach maturity, because their parents use the ravenous spawn for defense.   **Poisonous Lairs.** Coral drakes live in warm waters near great coral reefs. They hollow out small lairs and protect their meager hoards with the aid of the area’s natural inhabitants. Because they are immune to poison, coral drakes often choose lairs nestled in forests of poisonous sea urchins, stinging anemones, and toxic corals.   Aside from humankind, the coral drake harbors a great rivalry with dragon turtles. These beasts prize the same hunting grounds and nests and fight for supremacy in the richest reefs.</description>

  <description>_Crimson drakes are easy to spot, with scales the color of dried blood, a deadly scorpion stinger, and a mischievous gleam in their eyes._   **Fiery Raiders.** Crimson drakes lair in woodlands near small settlements, making nighttime forays to set fires and hunt those who flee the flames—traits that make humanoid tribes prize them as raiding partners. Goblins gleefully adopt a crimson drake as a mascot to burn things down while they get on with slaughtering people. Red dragons and flame dragons regard a crimson drake as a pet, at best, but this rarely works out. When it is inevitably insulted by its larger cousins, a malicious crimson drake may even intentionally set fires to blaze a trail for hunters to the dragon’s lair.   **Mistaken for Pseudodragons.** A crimson drake’s scales and features are quite similar to those of a pseudodragon, and they will imitate a pseudodragon’s hunting cry or song to trick victims into approaching. Once their prey gets close enough, they immolate it.   As with pseudodragons, they resemble a red dragon in all but size and the presence of the drake’s scorpion-like stinger. On average, a crimson drake weighs 12 lb, its body measures about 18 inches long, and its tail adds another 18 inches.   **Foul Familiars.** A crimson drake occasionally chooses to serve an evil spellcaster as a familiar; they are too mischievous to be loyal or trustworthy, but ferocious in defense of their master.</description>

  <description>_This large, unnerving drake’s glassy black scales have purple undertones. Its features are elongated and almost alien. Black, expressionless eyes stare ahead, and a barbed stinger sits at the end of a long tail._   **Friend to Ghouls.** The deep drake has made a niche for itself in subterranean realms, establishing trade with the darakhul and with other races of the underworld. The drakes’ poison ensures the ghouls have replacements when their population dwindles. In return, those underlings who fail their rulers become food for the drake.   **Love Darkness.** Life underground has warped the drakes. Whereas most drakes attach themselves to humanoids, these creatures feel much more at home with aberrations and undead. They avoid sunlight and are strictly nocturnal when on the surface.   **Few in Number.** A deep drake mates for life with another deep drake when two of these rare creatures meet. A hermaphroditic creature, the drake assumes a gender until it finds a mate, at which time it may change. Once every 10-20 years, the drakes reproduce, resulting in three or four three‑foot long, rubbery eggs. Occasionally, subterranean undead or aberrations take these eggs to their cities to train the young drakes. A “household drake” is a great status symbol in some deep places, and surface necromancers who have heard of them are often extremely eager to acquire one.   Deep drakes are 12 feet long, plus a three-foot long tail, and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their coloration makes them ideal predators in the subterranean dark.</description>

They devour entire goats and sheep and sometimes spell out messages with their bones. They make surprisingly good bandits, and sometimes ally themselves with bands of humanoids—their own share of plunder must always be clearly the largest share of any such arrangement.   **Solitary Lairs.** They haunt dark and lonely places, such as deep caves, dense forests, and shadowy ruins. They are longlived for drakes, often reaching 250 years of age, and mate rarely, abandoning their eggs shortly before hatching.   **Fade Into Shadows.** An elder shadow drake naturally fades from view in areas of dim light or darkness. Darkvision doesn’t overcome this, because the shadow drake doesn’t simply blend into shadows; it magically becomes invisible in them.</description>

  <description>_With its sharp angles and translucent skin, this draconic creature looks as if it were carefully folded from a massive sheet of paper, including its razor-sharp claws and teeth._   **Book and Map Erasers.** These drakes originated in exotic lands far away, where paper is as common as parchment and vellum. They now inhabit wide stretches of the world, and they seem to have edited their origins out of history.   Paper drakes are a bane to historians and spellcasters because they can erase ink and pigments, and they often do so at random simply for aesthetic purposes. They adore the possibility of a blank page, but they also sometimes erase one selectively to make beautiful patterns in the remaining ink.   **Correcting Errors.** Some paper drakes have a compulsion to correct errors in text or speech, and in these cases their strange ability isn’t a nuisance. Indeed, these paper drakes help scribes correct mistakes, update outdated text, or erase entire volumes so they can be hand-lettered again with different text.   **Tattoo Magicians.** Paper drakes are sometimes subjected to strange magical rituals in which wizards tattoo powerful runes and symbols onto their skin. Those who survive this process gain even stranger, esoteric abilities, such as the ability to “stamp” text or images with their feet, the ability to make illustrations move as if alive, or even the ability to erase the memory of written words from a person’s mind, much as they erase text from a page.   In their regular form, paper drakes reach just over four feet in length and weight around 30 lb. They are usually white or tan, but develop a brown or yellow tone as they age.</description>

This continues until the creature dies from Dexterity loss, recovers naturally by making successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or is cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic. After the disease ends, the victim recovers 1d3 lost Dexterity with each long rest; greater restoration or comparable magic can restore it all at once.</text>

  <description>_A motionless rust drake is easily mistaken for a pile of scrap metal._   **Shedding Rust.** Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes, this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of flakes.   **Warped Metallics.** Many sages claim that rust dragons are a perversion of nature’s order obtained either by the corruption of a metallic dragon’s egg or the transformation of such a dragon by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth about their origins.   **Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters.** These foul creatures feed on rust and are known as disease carriers.</description>

  <description>_Twinkling motes of light move around this draconic creature’s body like stars, their reflections twinkling across its metallic scales._   **Returned Travelers.** A drake’s curiosity sometimes drives it to seek experiences beyond its plane, and it finds companions with which it travels the multiverse. Such drakes return quite clearly changed in appearance, demeanor, and ability. Regardless of which type of drake embarked on the journey, the creature always returns as a star drake.   **Mortal Protectors.** Star drakes consider themselves protectors of the Material Plane. They view those from other planes as meddlers in the affairs of humanoid races, regarding fiends and celestials as equally threatening. Star drakes might negotiate with, drive off, or destroy such meddlers. Occasionally, they lead extraplanar incursions to make it clear outsiders are unwelcome.   **Glimmering Lights.** A star drake differs in appearance from dragons primarily by its mottled metallic scales and the nimbus of tiny stars surrounding its body. A star drake measures 10 feet long and weighs roughly 500 lb.</description>

  <description>_These winged snakes are coastal beasts and sometimes confused with true dragons or wyverns. They are neither, but quite deadly in their own right._   **Searing Acid.** Drakon fangs do not deliver venom; volatile acid constantly burbles up from a drakon's stomach and enhances its attacks. A caustic drool clings to creatures they bite, and drakons can also belch clouds of searing vapor. Their lairs reek with acidic vapors and droplets of searing liquid.   **Dissolving Gaze.** The gaze of a drakon can paralyze creatures and dissolve them.   **Coastal Beasts.** Drakons lair along warm, largely uninhabited coasts, where they explore the shores and the coastal shelf, spending as much time above the waves as under them. Fortunately, they rarely travel far inland.</description>

  <description>_This tattered skeletal humanoid resembles a monster from a nightmare. A dream eater’s natural form is mostly human in appearance, though with vestigial skeletal wings with a few feathers, small horns, sharp teeth, and cloven hooves. Most often they use magic to disguise themselves as attractive members of a humanoid race._   **Drawn to Sin.** Dream eaters are dedicated to lust, gluttony, and greed, and they make their lairs in casinos, brothels, thieves’ dens, and other locations where gambling, food, and other pleasures are readily available. Sometimes dream eaters work together to create such a place, especially near large towns or cities. Some band together to create traveling shows, offering all the oddities, whimsies, and flights of fantasy customary for such entertainers.   **Devouring Hopes.** Dream eaters lure people into their lairs, enticing them with promises of pleasure or wealth, but they make sure the odds are stacked in their favor. Eventually, their victims are left with nothing. Worse than the loss of physical treasures, though, dream eaters leave their victims stripped of all hopes and aspirations. Dream eaters feed on their emotions, leaving helpless thralls willing to sell their souls for their vices.   **Lords of Confusion.** When confronted, dream eaters are dangerous opponents. Using their innate abilities, they can drive enemies into a dream state, using the resulting confusion to make their escape while their foes destroy themselves.</description>

  <description>_The drowned maiden is usually found as the corpse of a women floating in the water, her long hair drifting with the current. Occasionally, these are drowned lads rather than maidens, though this is rare._   **Raging Romantics.** Drowned maidens are piteous but terrifying undead, created when a woman dies in water due to a doomed romance, whether from unrequited love or whether drowned by a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death seeking vengeance. Even as she dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden often anguishes over her doomed existence and tragic fate.   **Beckoning for Help.** The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she died—usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned. A drowned maiden uses her disguise self ability to appear as in life. She silently beckons victims from afar, as if in danger of drowning. When within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to kiss it. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim’s final vision is the drowned maiden’s tearful lament over the loss of life.   **Death to Betrayers.** Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens, and they will release pleading victims who promise to return to their lair with the person who caused the maiden’s death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath.</description>

Clothed in vines and leaves, it can be difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins._   **Creeper Vine Spirits.** Duskthorn dryads are spirits tied to thorn-bearing creeper vines. They seek out dead trees and use them as a home for their vines to cling to. They can travel through trees to escape their foes but must stay near their vines.   **Create Guardians.** Duskthorn dryads use their vines and the plants in their glades to defend themselves, animating enormously strong vine troll skeletons as well as ordinary skeletons, children of the briar, and other horrors. These defenders are linked to the tree and vines that animated them, are controlled by hearts within the tree. If the hearts are destroyed, the servants wither or scatter.</description>

    <text>When a creature that can see the eyes of the dullahan's severed head starts its turn within 30 feet of the dullahan, the dullahan can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the dullahan isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. While frightened in this way the creature must move away from the dullahan, and can only use its action to Dash. If the creature is affected by the dullahan's Deathly Doom trait, it is restrained while frightened instead. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the dullahan until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dullahan in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

  <description>_The black horse strides out of the shadows with its nostrils huffing steam. Its rider, swathed in black leather, raises his arm to reveal not a lantern but its own severed, grinning head._   Though it appears to be a headless rider astride a black horse, the dullahan is a single creature. The fey spirit takes the shape of the rider holding its own head aloft like a lantern, or (more rarely) the form of an ogre cradling its head in one arm.   **Harbingers of Death.** Hailing from the darkest of fey courts, the dullahan are macabre creatures that walk hand in hand with death. They sometimes serve powerful fey lords and ladies, riding far and wide in the capacity of a herald, bard, or ambassador. More often than not they carry doom to a wretch who roused their lord’s ire.   **Relentless Nature.** The dullahan doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Somewhere, dozens of them guard vast wealth.   **Spread by Spores.** Although not intended to reproduce, they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating themselves, so that now they’re spread across the deserts. Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just once per century.</description>

Predatory beasts as dangerous on land as they are in the water, they share their masters’ capricious cruelty. The hounds’ chilling hunting cries inspire their masters to a killing frenzy as they pursue foes. Few other creatures appreciate eel hounds’ lithe power and cruel grace, instead noting only their grotesque form and unnerving savagery.   **Slippery Ambushers.** Eel hounds are ambush predators, preferring to hide among the muck and algae of riverbanks, only to suddenly burst forth as a pack. They surround their prey, latching on with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey are dragged into the depths to drown. Similarly, eel hounds often force aquatic prey up onto dry land to die of suffocation.   Possessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by vomiting forth their slippery spittle where land animals come to drink or along game trails. They surge out of the water to snatch prey while it is off balance.   **Liquid Speech.** Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in other tongues.</description>

  <description>_Stout bearded warriors with golden auras, the einherjar wear chain mail and carry two-handed battle axes and oaken shields— their badges and symbols are all different, and it is said no two braid their beards quite alike._   As the spirits of warriors chosen by the valkyries and brought to Valhalla to fight for the gods against the giants, the einherjar are great warriors who eat and drink their fill of boar and mead each night, then spend their days preparing for Ragnarok. Some of this is combat training, and other portions are raids against the Jotun giants and thursir giants, to try their strength. Regardless of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning in Odin’s hall, so they have no fear of death, and their courage shames others into greater bravery.   **Defenders of the Mortal World.** From time to time, the ravenfolk guide a troop of the einherjar against some of Loki’s minions or the servants of Boreas. These raids are often small battles, but the einherjar know they are only delaying the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many evil spawn. This drives them to greater efforts against giants, demons, lindwurms, and other evil creatures, but the einherjar themselves are not exactly saintly. They drink, they carouse, they slap and tickle and brag and boast and fart with the loudest and most boastful of Asgardians. Unlike most extraplanar creatures, they are very human, if somewhat larger than life.   **Fear Dragons.** The einherjar have a notable soft spot for the ratatosk and the ravenfolk, but they are superstitiously fearful of dragons of all kinds. They sometimes hunt or ride or carouse with the fey lords and ladies.   **Never Speak to the Living.** In theory, the einherjar are forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their words through a valkyrie, a ratatosk, one of the ravenfolk, or other races allied with Asgard. In practice, this rule is often flouted, though if Loki’s servants notice it, they can dismiss any einherjar back to Valhalla for a day.</description>

  <description>_Eleinomae, or marsh nymphs, are beautiful fey who hold sway over many wetlands, from the chill to the tropical. They wear distinctive dresses fashioned from reeds and water lilies._   **Nets for Travelers.** Eleinomae are cruel and depraved creatures that seduce travelers with charms and illusions, then lead them to a watery grave. To capture their victims, eleinomae weave a net from swamp reeds and grasses, and decorate it with beautiful blossoms that release an intoxicating, bewitching aroma.   **Aquatic Cemeteries.** They are known to keep the most handsome captives as companions—for a time, at least, but they invariably grow weary of their company and drown them. Many eleinomae preserve the bodies of previous mates in aquatic cemeteries where the corpses float among fields of water lilies, and they spend much time singing to the dead. Such watery graveyards are often guarded by charmed allies of the eleinomae or other caretakers.   **Vain Singers.** While eleinomae have few weaknesses, their vanity and overconfidence can be exploited to vanquish them. They are proud of their sweet voices and clever creation of songs and harmonies.</description>

They are the ultimate personification of nature—the land itself come to life—varying in size from small hills to entire ridge lines, with no discernible pattern to where they take root.   **Stubborn Nature.** Elemental loci are fiercely protective of their chosen location. They tolerate no interference in the natural order and challenge all who despoil the land, be they mortal, monster, or god.   **Elemental Nature.** An elemental locus doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_“Kind words open even iron doors.”_   _—Twilight, a courtier to the shadow fey_   To most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of their power and culture.   Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they’re rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.   **Dual Natured.** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they’re also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.   **Split Rulership.** The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer.   Other fey call them the Scáthsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee), or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves an extension of the Seelie Court.   **The Reach of Darkness.** Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the fey—and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade goods, and their allies.   The shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey shun the sun’s light.</description>

  <description>_Witches and ioun mages know how to craft a speaking crystal. Its primary use is as a debating companion and ally—but many turn to treachery and hatred. These are the emerald eyes._   **Servants of Logic.** A mystic or psion will debate logic with a speaking crystal based on his rational mind, or discuss morality with a speaking crystal based on his conscience. Chaotic psions create speaking crystals based on their primal urges, and such crystals sometimes abandon or even kill their creators. Once free, they revel in the world’s pleasures.   **Trapped Manipulators.** Most speaking crystals are pink or purple when created, but those that betray their creators turn a dark shade of green. These floating oval-shaped crystals are physically weak, but they retain considerable magical powers to manipulate those around them. This becomes critically important when the emerald eye discovers that killing its creator frees it from the creator’s control but doesn’t free it from the need to remain within 25 feet of some creature it is bound to. This is often the dead body of its creator if no other creature is available.   **Shifting Goals.** An emerald eye’s motivations change over time. One may be purposeful, using its powers to drive its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might feign cooperativeness, offering to share its defensive abilities in exchange for the creature’s mobility. Still another might be a manipulative trickster, pretending to be an ioun stone, floating in circles around an ally’s or victim’s head while sparkling brightly to inspire jealousy and theft among its viewers.   Smaller than a clenched fist, an emerald eye weighs at most half a pound.   **Constructed Nature.** An emerald eye doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, this resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood._   **Silent Motion.** A billowing empty cloak glides through the air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master. Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly out of step with the frame bearing it.   **Guards.** Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians, empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor such as a monolith footman, and made to look like a display piece.   **Shadow Servants.** Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an empty cloak as their own clothing; they use it to cover a hasty retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.   **Constructed Nature.** An empty cloak doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

    <text>A future self of the eonic drifter materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the drifter. The future self has the eonic drifter's stats and its full hit points, and it takes its turn immediately after its present self. Killing the original eonic drifter makes its future self disappear. If the present self sees its future self die, the eonic drifter must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. There is no effect if the save succeeds. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d6 to determine the effect on the eonic drifter: 1 = frightened, 2 = incapacitated, 3 = paralyzed, 4 = unconscious, 5 or 6 = has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. These effects last 1d4 rounds.</text>

    <text>The future self makes a time warping staff attack against a target. If the attack hits, instead of causing bludgeoning damage, both the target and the attacker jump forward through time, effectively ceasing to exist in the present time. They reappear in the same locations 1d4 rounds later, at the end of the present self's turn. Creatures occupying those locations at that moment are pushed 5 feet in a direction of their own choosing. The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does not trigger a saving throw for the present self.</text>

  <description>_The air crackles and lights flicker in the ruins. In a whirl of colorful robes, the drifter materializes from the unfathomable maelstroms of time. His eyes scan the hall in panic, anticipating the terrible revelations of yet another era._   **Adrift in Time.** Not much is known about the time traveling eonic drifters other than that they left a dying civilization to look for help not available in their own age. To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved much more difficult than leaving it, so the eonic drifters found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with the flesh of their bodies. They have been become mummified by the passing ages.   **Crystal Belts.** A drifter carries an odd assembly of gear gathered in countless centuries, proof of its tragic journey. The more eclectic the collection, the more jumps it has performed on its odyssey.   Belts of crystals around its body store the energy that fuels a drifter’s travels. After each large jump through time, the reservoirs are exhausted and can be used only for very short jumps.   **Jittery and Paranoid.** Visiting countless eras in which mankind has all but forgotten this once-great civilization has robbed most eonic drifters of their sanity. Their greatest fear is being robbed of their crystal belts. They plead or fight for them as if their lives depended on them—which, in a sense, they do. Adventurers who convince a drifter of their good intentions may be asked for aid. In exchange, a drifter can offer long-lost artifacts gathered from many forays through time.   Drifters can appear at any time or place, but they often frequent the sites of their people’s past (or future) cities. There they are comforted by knowing that they’re at least in the right place, if not the right time.</description>

  <description>_These shy fairies dress as small fey herdsmen wearing tan hide armor, hide boots, cloaks, and cowls, all trimmed in fox fur and often with a red sash or tunic.

The far darrig were the hunters, herders, and equerry of the elven nobility—some still serve in this capacity in planes where the elves rule. Some stayed behind after the many of the fey retreated to wilder lands in the face of expanding human kingdoms.   Far darrig carry glaives made from fey antlers; each remains enchanted only as long as a far darrig holds it. Their leaders ride on fey elk the color of foxes, with gleaming green eyes; it is believed that their antlers are the ones used to make far darrig antler glaives.   **Hate Arcanists.** While not inherently evil, far darrig are hostile to all humans and will often attack human wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers on sight. If they can be moved to a friendly attitude through Persuasion or a charm spell or effect, they make very good guides, scouts, and hunters.   **Serve Hags and Worse.** They are sometimes found as thralls or scouts serving hags, trollkin, and shadow fey, but they are unwilling and distrustful allies at best.</description>

While disoriented, the creature falls prone each time it tries to move or take the Dash or Disengage action. To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its turn outside the fear smith's gaze and make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. To use this ability, the fear smith can't be incapacitated and must see the affected creature. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In that case, no saving throw is necessary but the creature treats the fear smith as invisible until the start of the creature's next turn.

Opening the large mouth in the center of its face reveals long needlelike teeth surrounding a single massive eye._   Known as a fiarsídhe among themselves, fear smiths are servants of the Court of the Shadow Fey and similar dark fey courts of such as those of Queen Mab and the Snow Queen.   _**Icy-Cold Eyes.**_ Fear smiths often serve as torturers or are dispatched to demoralize the court’s enemies. Their stare stops enemies cold, making it easy for heavily-armed warriors to trap and finish a foe.   _**Devour Fear.**_ As their nickname suggests, fear smiths feed off strong emotions, and their favorite meal is terror. The fey prefer prolonging the death of victims, and, when free to indulge, a fear smith stalks its victim for days before attacking, hinting at its presence to build dread.   _**Hoods and Masks.**_ Fear smiths favor fine clothing and high fashion, donning hooded cloaks or masks when discretion is required. Eerily well-mannered and respectful, fear smiths enjoy feigning civility and playing the part of nobility, speaking genteelly but with a thick, unidentifiable accent from within a cowl.</description>

    <name>Violent Escapement</name>
    <text>With little regard for the clockwork bodies they inhabit, fellforged wraiths can stress and strain their mechanisms in such a violent manner that flywheels become unbalanced, gears shatter, and springs snap. As a bonus action, this violent burst of gears and pulleys deals 7 (2d6) piercing damage to all foes within 5 feet who fail a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Each use of this ability imposes a cumulative reduction in movement of 5 feet upon the fellforged. If its speed is reduced to 0 feet, the fellforged becomes paralyzed.</text>

  <description>_A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton’s eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors._   **Wraith Constructs.** Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The wraiths twist the bodies to their own use—going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living.   **Soldiers for Vampires.** Fellforged commonly seek out greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are favorite leaders, but banshees and darakhul also make suitable commanders.   **Grave Speech.** The voice of the fellforged is echoing and sepulchral, a tomb voice that frightens animals and children.   **Constructed Nature.** A fellforged doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Taut dead skin, adorned entirely with tattooed fish scales, covers this woman’s face and hands. She wears scaled armor, sea green like verdigris on copper, and wields a strange sword. Her pale eyes stare, unblinking._   **Undead Warlock Slaves.** Ancient and powerful beings across the multiverse grant magical knowledge to mortals through dangerous pacts. Those bound to these pacts become warlocks, but the will and force of their patron is borne by more than just those who strike bargains for sorcerous power. A fext is a former warlock who has become wholly dedicated to their patron—mind, body, and soul—and functions as enforcer, bodyguard, and assassin. They are powerful undead slaves to the will of their otherworldly patron.   **Linked to a Master.** Each fext is a unique servant of their patron and exhibits the physical traits of its master. The eyes of every fext are tied directly to their patron’s mind, who can see what the fext sees at any time. The fext also possesses a telepathic link to its patron.   The process a warlock undergoes to become a fext is horrendous. The warlock is emptied of whatever morality and humanity he or she had as wine from a jug, and the patron imbues the empty vessel with its corruption and unearthly will. Whatever life the fext led before is completely gone. They exist only to serve.   **Outdoing Rivals.** Scholars have debated about how many fext a patron can command. The more powerful and well-established have at least 100, while others have only a handful. Where there is more than one fext, however, they maneuverings amongst themselves to curry favor with their powerful lord. Each fext is bound to obey commands, but they attempt to carry them out to the detriment of their competitors. Scheming is common and rampant among them and they try to work without the aid of other fext as much as possible.   **Undead Nature.** A fext doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

In this way, the artificers create massive, twisted trunks resembling real, gnarled trees. Green-tinged leaves of beaten cold iron are welded in place by the master craftsmen, and trained warmages bring the construct to life through intense magical rituals rumored to take a full turn of seasons.   **Fey Destroyers.** The tree unswervingly obeys the commands of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected faerie rings, or possible elf encampments. Many are released deep in the deep elvish woods with orders to attack any fey on sight. These feyward trees are rarely, if ever, heard from again and whether they leave a bloody trail of flayed elves in their wake after rampages lasting for decades or some fey counter-measure neutralizes them is unknown.   **Growing Numbers.** Each year, the feywardens order their construction and release, trusting in the destructive nature of the constructs. A half-dozen might guard a single ring of toppled elven standing stones. The feywardens leave nothing to chance.   **Constructed Nature.** A feyward tree doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_This proud bird struts like a peacock, made all the more majestic by its flaming fan of feathers, which shift through the color spectrum._   **Guides and Helpers.** Firebirds are welcome sights to those in need of warmth and safety. They primarily work at night or in underground areas, where their abilities are most needed. Friendly to all creatures, they become aggressive only upon witnessing obviously evil acts.   Firebirds enjoy working with good adventuring parties, providing light and healing, though their wanderlust prevents them from staying for long. Well-traveled parties may encounter the same firebird more than once, however.   **Redeemers.** Firebirds enjoy acting as reformers. They find mercenary creatures they perceive as potential “light bringers” to whom they grant boons in exchange for a geas to perform a specific good deed, in the hope such acts will redeem them.   **Magical Feathers.** Firebird feathers are prized throughout the mortal world; occasionally, the creatures bestow feathers upon those they favor. Firebirds also seed hidden locations with specialized feathers, which burst into full-grown firebirds after a year. As the creatures age, their feathers’ light dims, but this occurs gradually, as the creatures live over 100 years. Firebirds stand three feet tall and weigh 20 lb.</description>

  <description>_The people of Leng are hideous and malevolent, with goatlike legs and small horns they keep concealed beneath turbans, and mouths full of rows of serrated teeth, somewhat akin to sharks. They have a fondness for combining heavy leathers and bright silks in their robes, and they always go forth masked when leaving their mysterious, chilled cities._   **Dimensional Merchants.** The folk of Leng are interplanar merchants and avid slavers, trading silks, rubies, and the manaencrusted stones of Leng for humanoid slaves. They sail between worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They tend a few pyramids in the deep deserts and are said to befriend void dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the void.   **A High Plateau.** Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded by hills and peaks. Its greatest city is Sarkomand, a place which some claim has fallen into ruin, and which others claim to have visited in living memory.   **Love of Nets.** When in combat, the folk of Leng use nets woven from the silk of their racial enemies, the spiders of Leng. They summon these nets from interdimensional storage spaces.</description>

An exaggerated brow ridge juts out over piggish, close-set eyes, and corded muscle stands out all over the creature.   **Keep to the Wilderness.** Cruel and savage when encountered, their demeanor has worked against them and they have nearly been driven to extinction in places where they can be easily tracked. They have since learned to raid far from their hidden homes, leading to sightings in unexpected places.   **Orc Friends.** Forest marauders get along well with orcs and goblins, who appreciate their brute strength and their skill at night raids.</description>

  <description>_This slight creature resembles a goblin, but its blue skin and the icicles hanging from the tip of its long nose speak to the chilling truth._   The fraughashar are a race of short, tricky, and cruel fey who inhabit cold mountainous regions. Fraughashar have light blue skin, short pointed ears, and needlelike teeth. Delighting in mayhem, they always seem to have devilish grins on their faces.   **Sacred Rivers.** They view cold rivers and river gorges as sacred places in which their wicked god Fraugh dwells, and they likewise revere the snowy peaks where the Snow Queen holds sway. Fraughashar are fiercely protective of their territory, and their easy mobility over frozen and rocky terrain lets them make short work of intruders.   **Chilling Tales.** The origin of the strange and deadly fraughashar is unclear. Some druidic legends claim the fraughashar were born out of a winter so cold and cruel that the spirits of the river itself froze. Bardic tales claim that the fraughashar are a tribe of corrupted goblins, and that they were permanently disfigured during a botched attempt at summoning an ice devil. Whatever the truth of their beginnings, the fraughashar are cruel and merciless, and they will kill anyone who enters their land.</description>

  <description>_“They took the sled dogs first, and later the seal-skinner set to guard them. We’d hear a confused, muffled cry in the wind and then we’d find them—a raven harvest, cold and stiff on the ice. Next time, we hid ourselves and watched, and saw them floating through the air like kites. A wisp of blowing snow that never dispersed, a billowing, snowflake sail moving with sinister purpose. The ‘cloak of death’ our skraeling guide called it.”_   Whipped through the air by snowstorms and resembling a spider’s web dangling with delicate ice crystals, these silently gliding, beautiful killers are semi-sentient plants adapted to the merciless cold of the North.   **Cloak of Death.** Flat nodes shaped like large snowflakes connect their net-like bodies and trailing tails of transparent fibers. Gossamer tendrils stream behind and between the flying snowflakes, ready to grab and entangle any warm-blooded creature it detects.   **Seek Warmth.** Each star-like node contains crude sensory organs, able to detect warmth as meager as a living creature’s breath and steer the gliding web toward it.   **Spirit Spores.** Northern shamans say the dance of the frostveils is beautiful when lit by the northern lights, and a powerful omen. With great care, shamans sometimes harvest frostveils for their frozen spore-shards, which grant potent visions of the spirit world when melted on the tongue.</description>

  <description>_These aggressive, blue-black freshwater crabs inhabit rivers and streams, scuttling along the muddy terrain in search of prey._   **Strangling Claws.** Garroter crabs are named for their abnormal right claws, which have evolved over time to strangle prey like a barbed whip.   **Clacking Hordes.** Their long whip-claw is lined with powerful muscles and joints at the beginning, middle, and end that give it great flexibility. During mating season, thousands of garroter crabs congregate in remote riverbanks and marshes, and the males whip their shells with a clacking sound to attract a mate.   **Small Prey.** Garroter crabs prey on rodents, cats, and other small animals caught by the riverbank.</description>

  <description>_A large reptile with a dagger-like teeth and a scaly hide of shifting colors, the gbahali often strikes from close range._   _**Chameleon Crocodiles.**_ While distantly related to crocodiles, gbahali have adapted to life away from the water. To make up for the lack of cover, gbahali developed chameleon powers. Gbahali hide changes color to match its surroundings so perfectly that it becomes nearly invisible. Any lonely rock on the grassland might be a gbahali waiting along a trail, caravan route, or watering hole. Their thick hide can be made into hide or leather armor, and with the proper alchemical techniques it retains some of its color-shifting properties.   _**Strong Hunters.**_ Gbahalis are powerful predators, challenged only by rivals too large for a gbahali to grapple or by predators that hunt in packs and prides, such as lions and gnolls. Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for plains hunters.   _**Sentries and Stragglers.**_ In combat, a gbahali relies on its chameleon power to ambush prey. It may wait quietly for hours, but its speed and stealth mean it strikes quickly, especially against weak or solitary prey. Its onslaught is strong enough to scatter a herd and leave behind the slowest for the gbahali to bring down.</description>

  <description>_A savage parody of a djinni, an al-Aeshma’s lower half is composed of scorching winds and desert sand._   **Sand Djinnis.** The al-Aeshma are former djinn and share the same powers, albeit in a darker style. Their skin is black as pitch, and their whirlwind form includes much dust and sand. Only radiant or fire damage can slay them entirely—otherwise the desert sand flows to seal their wounds and reattach severed limbs.   **Obligation of Wishes.** Granting three wishes to a mortal is a sacred and serious obligation among the genies, referred to as being wishbound. The Lords of Air mandate this as celestial law, and many believe that a djinni cannot refuse to grant a wish. Certainly the consequences of disobedience are dire.   Those djinn who decline to grant a wish, for any reason, are stripped of their wish power and handed to efreeti for 1,001 years of torture and debasement. Those that survive are banished to wander the Material Plane.   **Unforgiven.** No al-Aeshma has ever been forgiven. Their punishment drives them mad, and makes them anything but contrite. Al-Aeshma are a feral, mocking scourge to all other genies, even efreeti, for they know many secrets and their hearts lust for revenge.</description>

  <description>_These large water-striding insects resemble a strange cross between camels and wingless, long-legged locusts. A rider can comfortably sit in the large hollow in the small of their backs, even at high speeds or on choppy water. Riders use the gerridae’s long, looping antennae to steer._   **Elvish Water Steeds.** Known by their Elvish name, these large fey water striders were enchanted and bred by the elves in ages past, when their explorers roamed the world. Elven mages started with normal water striders and—through elaborate magical procedures and complex cross-breeding programs— transformed the mundane water striders into large, docile mounts. They can cross large bodies of water quickly while carrying a humanoid rider, even in windy conditions.   **Sturdy Mounts.** A gerridae can carry up to 300 pounds of rider and gear before being encumbered, or 600 while encumbered.   **Fond of Sweet Scents.** Gerridae can sometimes be distracted by appealing scents, such as apple blossom or fresh hay. They are also fond of raw duck and swan.</description>

  <description>_Distilled to nothing but dry, whispering sand and a full set of teeth, a bonepowder ghoul still hungers for flesh and blood. Its dusty mass is perfected corruption, entirely animated by foul energy._   **Starved Into Dust.** The bonepowder ghoul is small and unassuming, a pile of dust and bone fragments that resemble a pile of mummy dust or the remnants of a vampire burned by sunlight. Ghouls can achieve this powdery form through long starvation. The process invariably takes decades, which is why so few bonepowder ghouls exist—few ghouls can show such self-restraint. Even among imperial ghouls, using hunger as a form of torture is considered offensive and is quite rare. A bonepowder ghoul may rise from the remnants of a starved prisoner or a ghoul trapped in a sealed-off cavern, leaving behind its remnant flesh and becoming animated almost purely by hunger, hatred, and the bitter wisdom of long centuries.   **Mocking and Hateful.** Bonepowder ghouls are creatures of pure evil, seeking to devour, corrupt, and destroy all living things. The only creatures they treat with some affinity are ghouls. Even in that case, their attitude is often mocking, hateful, or condescending. They have some mild respect for darakhul nobles.   **Whispering Voices.** Most bonepowder ghouls speak at least 4 languages, but their voices are very faint. Just to hear one speaking normally requires a DC 15 Perception check. Undead gain a +8 competence bonus to this check.</description>

    <name>Darakhul Fever</name>
    <text>spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

  <description>_The towering woman rises up from the desert sand. Her pale brown robe almost perfectly matches the gritty terrain, and her roughly textured skin is a rich walnut brown._   Desert giants live in arid wastelands that were once a thriving giant empire. Their rich brown skin is rough-textured, and they dress in light robes matching the color of the sand, accented (when they aren’t trying to blend in) with brightly colored head cloths and sashes. Beneath their robes, the desert giants paint or tattoo their skin with intricate designs in a riot of colors that outsiders rarely see.   **Wandering Legacy.** Desert giants subsist in the scorching wastes by moving from oasis to oasis. They follow herds of desert animals that they cultivate for milk, meat, and hides, and they shun most contact with settled people. They can survive the blazing heat of the high summer, because desert giants know secret ways with relatively plentiful water and the location of cool, shaded caverns.   While in ages past the desert giants lived in stationary settlements and cities, the fall of their ancient empire drove them into the dunes. The truth behind their nomadic lifestyle is a sore spot; should any outsider learn the truth, the desert giants stop at nothing to permanently silence the inquisitive soul.   **Keepers of the Past.** Over time, wandering desert giants amass vast knowledge of ruins and relics scattered across and beneath their homeland. On rare occasions that the tribes require something of outsiders, this information is their most valuable commodity. Relics of the past, or simply the location of unplundered ruins, can purchase great advantage for the tribe.   The designs the giants painstakingly inscribe on their bodies tell a tale that, if woven together correctly, reveals an entire tribe’s collected discoveries. For this reason, the desert giants hold the bodies of their dead in sacred esteem. They go to extraordinary lengths to recover their dead, so they can divide the knowledge held on the deceased’s skin among other tribe members. In the cases of desert giant elders, this hidden writing may be equivalent to spell scrolls.</description>

  <description>_This obese, bell-shaped giant is blemished by ulcers, enlarged veins, and fungal rashes. Though it stumbles about on a pair of short, calloused legs, it moves its weight with dangerous potential, catching many foes off-guard._   **Great Girth.** Whether as a result of a centuriespast curse or a gradual adaptation to an easy-going existence, the flab giant (one of the shortest breeds of giant) is gigantic in width rather than height and almost comical in its simple life.   Too obese to effectively grasp weapons in its chubby fingers, a flab giant uses its great mass to deadly effect, overrunning or grabbing opponents and then sitting on them to crush them to death, swatting away missiles, and simply putting up with the damage of melee attacks until its victims stop struggling and it gets up to see if they’re dead yet.   **Efficient Foragers.** Flab giants are the least active of giant types, spending most of their waking hours resting, napping, and sleeping, and only devote a short period each day to listlessly shuffling about, scrounging for food. Because a flab giant can eat practically anything, it doesn’t have to roam far to find enough food to sustain its bulk, so it is rarely found far from its crude lair.   **Knotted Skins.** Flab giants wear only scraps of clothing made of loosely knotted skins, leaving most of their stretch-marked and discolored skin exposed. Favored pelts include bear and human. A flab giant stands eight to ten feet tall and weighs 1,000 to 1,500 pounds.</description>

    <name>Hraesvelgr's Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Hraesvelgr takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Hraesvelgr can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Hraesvelgr unleashes a blast of wind in a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

- One creature within 60 feet that Hraesvelgr can see must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept up in a pillar of wind. The creature is restrained and suspended 15 feet off the ground. If the creature has something to pull on, it can pull itself out of the wind by using an action and making a successful DC 15 Strength check; another creature who can reach the suspended creature can pull it free in the same way. Alternatively, a flying creature can repeat the saving throw as an action. On a success, it moves 5 feet out of the pillar of wind. This effect lasts until Hraesvelgr takes this action again or dies.

- Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow in giant form or an ear-splitting shriek in roc form. All creatures within 30 feet must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

    <name>Regional Effects</name>
    <text>the region containing Hraesvelgr's lair is warped by the corpse swallower's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Strong windstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.

- Giant avian beasts are drawn to the lair and fiercely defend it against intruders.

- The wind within 10 miles of the lair bears a pungent carrion stench.

if Hraesvelgr dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

A swallowed creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of Hraesvelgr's turns. If Hraesvelgr returns to giant form, or takes 40 damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature, he must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which land prone within 10 feet of the giant. If Hraesvelgr dies, swallowed creatures are no longer restrained and can escape the corpse by spending 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

  <description>_The earth shudders with every footfall of a Jotun giant, the immortal enemies of the gods. Tall enough to look a titan in the eye and strong enough to wrestle a linnorm, Jotun gaints are the lords of giantkind. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and glaciers throughout the frozen wastes._   **Foes of the Gods.** As foes of the northern gods, they plot to regain their former status as lords of Creation. Many know ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and so may have abilities beyond those listed below. More powerful Jotun giants straddle the line between mortal and demigod.   **Contests and Challenges.** Like many giants, the Jotun enjoy a challenge, even from tiny little humans. Only the mightiest heroes can challenge a Jotun giant’s might in physical combat. Using cunning or trickery is a safer bet—though being too cunning is also angers them, and Jotun giants are no fools.   **Seekers of Ragnarok.** The Jotun giants know great magic, and strive to bring about end times of Ragnarok.</description>

  <description>_Heavily armored and carrying two rune-marked hammers, a thursir giant’s reddish hair and beard are often plaited in the style of an enormous dwarf._   **Forge Masters.** Greedy and aggressively competitive, thursir dwell in vast caverns under frozen mountains where they labor to forge chains, armor, and massive engines of war. Thursir giants have a natural affinity for metalworking. Any armor or weapons forged by a thursir giant are of the highest quality and can fetch double the usual price for such an item.   **Enormous Appetites.** When not toiling at the forge, these giants entertain themselves with gluttonous feasts and boisterous wrestling competitions, or raid human settlements for food and valuables.   **Hearth Rune Priestesses.** Female priestesses have a much higher standing in their society than other female thursir giants, who are treated shabbily. Most female thursir giants are drudges, considered fit only for child-bearing and menial labor. However, male thursir are makers, warrior, and metalworkers, while women make up the bulk of their priesthood and spellcasters. As priests and casters, they are valued advisors and held in high regard—or at least very valuable property.   Thursir stand nine feet tall and weigh 600 lb.</description>

The area inside the sphere is heavily obscured for 1 minute (10 rounds) in still water or 5 (2d4) rounds in a strong current. After stirring up the silt, the glass gator can move its speed.</text>
  </reaction>
  <description>_So called by some watermen because of its method of hunting, the glass gator is a nearly-transparent ambush hunter. It usually strikes from a bed of water, either stagnant or flowing. The transparency of the creature, combined with its jet of silt and poisonous sting, make it an effective hunter._   **Strange Anatomy.** The body of a glass gator is most similar to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more distinct head. The forelimbs are used to attack, but they tire easily, forcing the glass gator to use its powerful lunge attack sparingly.   Once the glass gator gets hold of prey, it wraps its body around the victim and squeezes, like a constrictor snake. Unlike a serpent, however, which uses powerful muscles to crush and suffocate its prey, the glass gator is only trying to bring its underbelly into contact with the prey. The glass gator’s belly is lined with hundreds of stingers that deliver a virulent nerve toxin.   **Transparency.** The glass gator’s transparency isn’t total. Its digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most vulnerable just after eating, when it’s lethargic; if encountered in its lair shortly after a meal, the DM may give the glass gator disadvantage on initiative.   **Larval Form.** Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It’s been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.</description>

  <description>_A gnarljak looks like a bear trap springs sprung to clacking life and ready to tear flesh apart._   **Hopping Motion.** All steel and springs, a gnarljak is easily mistaken for a simple bear trap when lying dormant. But once it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.   **Endless Snapping.** Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew through them, then turn around and chew through them again.   **Defensive Traps.** Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use gnarljak’s with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of making them part of a standard tunnel defense.</description>

Only the canny glint in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner explodes into violence.   _**Blinding Raids.**_ Havoc runners are scouring storms across the trade routes that crisscross the tribe’s territory. Like all gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders: they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is unparalleled.</description>

  <description>_This hunched, man-like figure lurches with a strange, half-hopping gait. Tattered clothing hangs from its muscled shoulders, and its legs are those of a ram, ending in cloven hooves._   **Trespassers on the Rites.** The first of the goat-men was the victim of a powerful curse intended to punish him for spying on magical rites exclusive to the women of his tribe. Admiring the grotesque result, the Black Goat of the Woods With a Thousand Young adopted him as its servant, and ensured that all who committed the same taboo fell to the same curse, and thus into the Black Goat’s service.   **Bleating Speech.** A goat-man’s head is tusked, adorned with curling ram’s horns, and its beard often drips with gore. Rows of transparent, needle-like teeth fill its mouth; these teeth are malformed and make clear speech impossible for goat-men, though they understand others’ speech perfectly well.   **Serve Foul Cults.** Cultists of Shub-Niggurath or the Black Goat in good standing are sometimes granted the services of a goat-man. The creatures guard rituals sites, visit settlements to capture or purchase suitable sacrifices, and perform certain unspeakable acts with cult members to call forth ritual magic.</description>

  <description>_A ragged creature emerges from the sand. Its spindly frame is encased in a hodge‑podge of armor scraps and rusted weapons. A long, hooked nose protrudes over a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth._   Dust goblins vary greatly in size and appearance, although they are universally scrawny, bony, and lanky. They seem to suffer from malnutrition even when in perfect health, a perception reinforced by the way their bellies distend after they’ve gorged themselves on flesh. Their skin is always dry and cracked, ranging from dusky gray to dark green in color.   **Rule the Wastelands.** Dust goblins are twisted creatures, tainted by many generations of life in a blasted wasteland. After a magical war devastated the dust goblins’ homeland, they rose to become the most dominant inhabitants. They inhabit ancient ruins and ambush travelers who stray too close to their borders.   **Twisted Minds.** The lingering magical energy saturating the wastes of their home, coupled with the harsh conditions in which they scratch out a living, have tainted the minds of all dust goblins. Their thinking is alien and unfathomable to most creatures. Whereas most goblins are cowardly, dust goblins don’t seem to experience fear. To the contrary, they enjoy wearing skull helmets and using ghostly whistles to frighten foes. Owing to this alien mindset, dust goblins get along disturbingly well with aberrations. The creatures often forge alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making their unnerving mark on communal lairs.   Dust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds.</description>

  <description>_An eye golem is muscular giant, well-proportioned with smooth, marble-white skin covered in eye-like sigils. When it opens one of its eyes opens for a moment, a beam as bright as the sun shines forth, piercing the darkness._   **Covered in Arcana.** Eye golems stand at least ten feet tall, and their magically durable hide is covered with real eyes as well as arcane sigils that resemble eyes.   **Blinds Victims.** An eye golem rarely kills its victims, but leaves them blinded, wandering and tormented, seeing only visions of the eye golem flashing through their memory. This drives some mad while others instead choose to serve the golem, becoming devoted to the one who still holds sight.   **All Eyes Open.** When killed, an eye golem does not simply fall down dead. All of its eyes open at once, a deafening bellow is heard for miles, and a blinding burst of light shines from the body. When the light and noise stop, hundreds of perfectly preserved eyeballs are left on the ground, still warm and fresh and without scars or damage. Thin beams of arcane energy connecting the eyes to their owners can be detected with a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Those who wield the central eye once the golem is slain can use it to restore stolen eyes to their victims.   **Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A hoard golem is a pile of gold, jewelry, and weapons that can rise on its own like a tidal wave of riches, with a cold and determined face. A hoard golem can crash down with the weight of a fortune, flattening everything in its path._   **Dragon Fears Made Real.** The hoard golems were born from the paranoia of dragons. Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.   **Patient Homebodies.** As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner’s den.   **Silent and Wealthy.** Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb. A hoard golem’s body is composed of items—copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor, weapons, and magical items—worth at least 5,000 gp.   **Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A salt golem is a crudely sculpted, roughly humanoid crystalline form that shuffles about on wide, stump-like feet. Tiny salt crystals fall from its body in a glittering cloud with every step._   **Coastal Druids.** These unnatural creatures are created by druids and others living in coastal or desert regions, or by those who seek to wage war with creatures susceptible to the warding powers of salt. Stories tell of a druid who built a squad of nine salt golems to combat a rampaging zmey. The salt warriors waged a long hunt and eventually killed the powerful dragon in its lair while the creator druid and her wizard companion reaped the spoils of its hoard.   **Crystalline and Silent.** A salt golem has a crudely formed humanoid body made of crystalline salts. It wears no clothing or armor and carries no weapons or other possessions. It cannot speak—the only sound it makes is the susurrus of sliding sand as it moves. A salt golem is incapable of strategy or tactics. It mindlessly fights until it destroys its opponents or until ordered to stop by its creator.   **Valuable Remains.** A salt golem stands about eight feet tall and weighs around 1,000 lb. A salt golem’s body is formed from a composite of at least 1,000 lb of rare salts and minerals worth at least 2,500 gp.   **Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

If it succeeds, the water instantly evaporates and the golem continues functioning normally. If it fails, the golem's fire is extinguished and the boiler loses pressure.

  <description>_With wicked axe blades fastened along its arms and bronze runes inlaid on its armored torso, a steam golem is a smooth-running machine of death._   **Magic Weapons.** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.   **Boilers and Hydraulics.** A steam golem is built around a central boiler with clockwork gears and hydraulic cylinders powering its legs and arms. Most steam golems have axe blades welded onto each of their arms, and many can extend one arm into a single, long-hafted axe for additional reach. They tower 10 feet tall, and their legs are often built with reversed knee joints for greater leverage when they move. The eyes of a steam golem glow orange or red from its internal fires.   **Steam Whistle.** A steam golem has four to six vents for releasing steam. These whistles are mounted over the shoulders and can be heard at distances up to a mile in open terrain.   **Fuel Required.** A steam golem’s machinery consumes 30 lb. of coal and 100 gallons of water per day if it engages in more than brief combat. When resting or standing guard, a steam golem needs just one third of those amounts.   **Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Skin as dry as parchment clings to the bones that are clearly distinguishable underneath. A hoarse moaning emanates from the dry, cracked lips._   **Thirsting Undead.** The greatest danger to people traversing badlands and deserts is thirst, and even the best prepared can find themselves without water. The lucky ones die quickly, while those less fortunate linger in sun-addled torment for days. These souls sometimes rise from the sand as gray thirsters, driven to inflict the torment they suffered upon other travelers.   **Destroy Wells and Oases.** Gray thirsters destroy or foul sources of water and often lurk nearby to ambush those seeking clean water.   **Thirsting Caravan.** Though they hunt alone, in at least one case an entire caravan died of thirst and rose again as gray thirsters. Called the dust caravan, it prowls the deep desert accompanied by skinchanging gnolls, shrieking ghouls, and a mummy lord, building a strange nomadic army.   **Undead Nature.** A gray thirster doesn’t require air, food, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers about while making jokes that mock mortality._   **Amusing Death.** When a jester on his deathbed moves an evil death god to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve. becoming a grim jester, whose pranks serve to entertain the god of death. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.   **Grisly Humor.** A grim jester’s jokes are not funny to their victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke might be absurd, such as “Here is your final pineapple soul, a parting gift, goodbye.” or sheer braggadocio such as “Your footwork is atrocious, and your spell’s lost its focus, your party’s no match for my hocus-pocus.” Others might be high-flown, such as “Mortal, your time has come, the bell within your skull does ring, ding, dong, dead.” Grim jesters are famous for grim, bitter mockery such as “Your blood on fire, your heart pumps its last, show me now a hero’s last gasp!” or “Odin’s raven has come for you; the Valkyries were busy. You lose, mortal.”   A grim jester’s mockery rarely entertain the living—but gods of death, chained angels, and demons find them quite amusing.   **Randomness.** Grim jesters often get their hands on wands of wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with a deck of many things—they are quite talented in pulling cards whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.   **Undead Nature.** A grim jester doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_The gugs are giants of the underworld, long since banished into dark realms for their worship of the eldest and foulest gods._   **Underworld Godlings.** Gugs enjoy smashing and devouring lesser creatures, and their burbling and grunting speech displays a surprising and malign intelligence to those few who can understand it. Gugs are occasionally worshipped by tribes of derro, and their strange underworld cities are filled with filled with esoteric monoliths and constructs.   **Nocturnal Raiders.** While gugs are banished into the underworld in mortal realms, they regularly flout this prohibition by raiding the surface by night. They also spend much time in the Dreamlands and the Ethereal plane; some gug warlocks and sorcerers are said to travel the planes with entourages of fext or noctiny.   **Prey on Ghouls.** Gugs devour ghouls and darakhul as their preferred foodstuffs. When these are not available, they seem to prefer carrion and particular varieties of psychotropic mushrooms, as well as something that is best described as candied bats.</description>

The first blood hags appeared when a red hag mated with a mad vampire archmage­­—their offspring became the first blood hags. Many more followed.   **Face Stealers.** Blood hags prey on mankind, stealing their seed to propagate, their blood to satisfy their insatiable thirst, and their faces as trophies of these short-lived and bloody trysts.   **Worm Hair.** A blood hag’s hair is a morass of wriggling worms, ever thirsty for fresh blood.</description>

  <description>_A mirror hag forces an unsuspecting creature to reflect on its own superficiality by gazing into the hag’s horrible face._   **Hideous Hex.** Until a creature can see past the hag’s deformities, it suffers the pain of a disfigured life. Some mirror hags do this for the betterment of all, but most do it because causing pain amuses them.   **Warped Features.** Mirror hags are hunchbacked, with growths and lesions covering their skin. Their joints misalign, and the extremities of their bones press against their skin. However, it is their faces that inspire legends: the blackest moles sprouting long white hairs, noses resembling half-eaten carrots, and eyes mismatched in size, color, and alignment. If a creature recoils from a mirror hag’s looks, she bestows her reconfiguring curse on it.   **Mirror Covens.** Mirror hags can form a coven with two other hags. Generally, mirror hags only form covens with other mirror hags, but from time to time a mirror hag will join a coven of witches or green hags.</description>

Few know anything about them, and the hags do little to enlighten them, preferring their seclusion.   **Tied to Nature.** The hags have a deep connection with all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.   **Blood Magic.** Because of their close connection to nature, red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles, however, they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic blood magic—both to slake their craving for humanoid blood, but also as a means to venerate Hecate, goddesses of dark magic. Red hags also favor the cleric and wizard classes; few ever seek a martial path. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy.</description>

  <description>_This withered crone glares malevolently, her face framed by lank gray hair. Her malicious grin is filled with shark teeth, and drool trickles from her lips._   **Hatred of Beauty.** Sand hags are terrifying crones that haunt desert ruins and forgotten oases. Their hatred for things of beauty and peace is terrible to behold. A sand hag uses her illusions and mimicry to lure travelers into an ambush.   **False Oasis.** They delight in tricking a caravan into an illusory oasis, killing all the riding animals and pack animals so the travelers can’t flee, and then terrifying and slaughtering them one by one.   **Drain Bodies.** For the slaughter of animals or humanoids, a sand hag prefers to rely on her claws, which drain the moisture from their victims. They leave the mummified remnants in postures of life—tied to a saddle, or atop a guard tower—to terrify others.   Sand hags stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weigh less than 150 lb., and dress in torn and tattered robes. Although skeletally thin, a sand hag’s apparent frailty belies her prodigious strength.</description>

  <action>
    <name>Luring Song</name>
    <text>The owl harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes incapacitated. While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy's song for 24 hours.</text>

  <description>_This winged woman’s face is wreathed in a headdress of feathers; her luminous eyes and aquiline nose lend beauty to her feral demeanor. Her sharp, taloned feet seem even more inhuman by comparison._   **Harpy Queens.** An owl harpy is a queen among her kind, possessing superior grace and intelligence and an owl's predatory instinct and savage appetite. Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp. They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in deserts and jungles.   **Noctural Magic.** Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunder attacks distress them.   Owl harpies are natural (if irredeemably evil) bards thanks to their sharp wits. Less common but not unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures.</description>

  <description>_A thick swirl of dust rises, settles, and forms the vague outline of a man—two points of yellow light shine where its eyes should be, staring malevolently._   **Mound Haunter.** A haugbui is an undead spirit tied to its burial mound or barrow. It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight, sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income in the mound. A freshly-woken haugbui devours the remains of creatures it was buried with, such as a hawk, hound, or horse.   **Milder Spirits.** Haugbuis are related to vaettir, but much older. They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage, and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated, and thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.   **Scrye and Watch.** They prefer to watch over their people from within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their mounds thanks to their scrying ability.   **Undead Nature.** A haugbui doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_The heralds of blood are 20-foot-tall giants with bruised purple skin, and wart-like blood blisters that deform their features. They often wear cowled robes over golden armor streaked with black or green, and their staves of power are always ebony and mithral, embedded with precious stones._   As powerful sorcerers and blood mages, heralds of blood are without peer. They enjoy enslaving ogres and giants whenever possible, though they make do with lesser slaves when they must.   **Dark Prophets.** Their stirring speeches proclaim that the end times are fast approaching, and their followers must prepare for a bloody reckoning. Behind their charismatic preaching, the heralds of blood serve elder earth gods that demand blood sacrifices, especially dark druid orders devoted to human hunts and the murder of innocents. They have the power to grant strength, lust, and vitality—or to wither those who cross them.   **Blood Magic Vortexes.** In their true form, which they keep hidden except in battle, heralds of blood are swirling vortexes of blood, bone, and raw magical power. They feed on ley line magic and the black blood of the earth as much as on flesh and blood.</description>

  <description>_Stunningly tall and beautiful fiends, the heralds of darkness resemble dark-haired fey wearing cloaks and armor glittering with dark light and often surrounded by a nimbus of pale green fire._   Heralds of darkness speak in fluid tones and sing with the voices of angels, but their hearts are foul and treacherous.   **Vision of Evil.** Indeed, the heralds of darkness can take on another appearance entirely, disappearing into insubstantial shadows and unveiling an evil majestic form that leaves those who see it shaken and weak—and often blind. Speaking of this form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and the slow death of children carried along in a glacial river, rushing to an inevitable doom.   **Sword and Cloak.** The black sword and star-scattered cloak of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and cannot be parted from it. Some believe the cloak and blade are true visions of its body; the smiling face and pleasing form are entirely illusory.   **Corruptors of the Fey.** The heralds of darkness are companions and sometimes masters to the shadow fey. They seek to draw many others into their orbit with wild promises of great power, debauchery, and other delights. They are rivals to the heralds of blood and bitter foes to all angels of light.</description>

  <description>_Resembling a cave cricket the size of a dog, this beast wraps its victim in spiny legs and claws when it attacks. A horakh’s black, chitinous thorax is topped by a translucent digestive sac—often containing half-digested eyeballs of varying sizes, colors, and species._   **Leaping Claws.** Insectoid killing machines with a penchant for consuming their victim’s eyes, the bloodthirsty horakhs travel in small packs and make lightning-fast attacks against the weak or vulnerable. Their powerful rear legs enable enormous bounding leaps, while the sharp hooks at the end of their powerful claws help them to climb and latch onto prey. Heads dominated by scooped mandibles that can shoot forward like pistons, shearing meat from bone.   **Leaping Screech.** When attacking, a horakh leaps from its hiding spots while making a deafening screech. Horakhs are highly mobile on the battlefield. If threatened, horakhs return to the shadows to attack from a more advantageous position.   **Herd the Blinded.** After blinding their prey, horakh often herd the blind like sheep until they are ready to consume them and even use them as bait to capture other creatures. Many an explorer has been ambushed, blinded, and condemned to death in the bowels of the earth by these predators.</description>

  <description>_These enormous black hounds are most commonly seen panting in the moonlight, wisps of steam rising from their muzzles, while they accompany a nocturnal hunting party._   **Fey Bloodhounds.** Hounds of the night are bred by the shadow fey for use as hunting companions and guardians, and they excel at both tasks. Far more intelligent than other hounds, they are difficult to evade once they are on a quarry’s trail, because they can think their way past problems that would throw their lesser kin off the trail. Their shadow fey masters claim that hounds of the night can smell a shadow on running water and can sniff out a ghost passing through a wall.   **Cousins to Winter.** Somewhere in their early existence as a breed, some enterprising hunter interbred them with winter wolves. Every trace of their white fur is long gone, but the cold breath of those dread canines remains.   **Dimensional Stepping.** Hounds of night excel at distracting prey while some of their pack uses dimension door to achieve some larger goal, such as dragging off a treasure or overwhelming a spellcaster in the back ranks.</description>

  <trait>
    <name>Unleashed Emotion</name>
    <text>When a hulking whelp feels threatened - it's touched, intimidated, cornered, attacked, or even just if a stranger moves adjacent to the whelp - it immediately grows from size Small to Huge as a reaction. If the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs after the attack is made but before damage is done. Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn't much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it's affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn't entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking whelp's Unleashed Emotion can last for days.</text>

  <description>_This gray-skinned dog-like creature seems pathetically eager to please but fantastically skittish, its ears alerting at every nearby sound, and its large oval eyes following anything that passes by._   **Emotional Giant.** A hulking whelp is a tightly wound ball of emotion, extremely private and defensive of its personal space, and terrified of the world around it. When it feels its personal space violated, or its fragile concentration is broken, the small, quivery fey grows into a muscled beast of giant proportions.   **Calm Friend.** When its emotions are under control, a hulking whelp is friendly and even helpful, although this has more to do with its guilt over past actions and fear of what it might do if it feels threatened than a true desire to help others. In its calm form, a hulking whelp is just over three feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 50 lb. Unleashed, it is 20 feet tall and 4,000 lb.</description>

  <description>_A toothless mouth adorns the headless shoulders of this oversized, four-armed, doughy humanoid. Colors and half-formed phantasmal shapes appear and vanish around it, to the creature’s obvious delight._   **Creative Chaos.** Wise yet child-like creatures of chaos, hunduns are four-armed, headless humanoids that embody spontaneous creation and the confusion that precedes enlightenment. Taking delight in creation of all kinds, they bring change to the staid and stagnant, spin revelation from confusion, and inspire moments of great creation—from works of art to new nations and faiths, and even the formation of planets and planes.   **Nonsense Speech.** Although not mindless, hunduns rarely seem to act out of conscious thought, yet their actions seem wise and usually benevolent. They communicate only in nonsense words, but have no trouble communicating among themselves or acting in coordination with other hunduns.   **Flesh of Creation.** Hundun blood is a powerful catalyst, and their spittle a potent drug. Each hundun’s heart is an Egg of Worlds—an artifact that can give birth to new concepts, powers, or even worlds. Obviously, the hundun must die for its heart to be used this way, but this is a sacrifice one might make willingly under the right circumstances.</description>

  <description>_This alluring beauty has flesh and hair as white as snow and eyes blue as glacial ice._   **Born of the Ice.** Ice maidens are the daughters of powerful creatures of the cold. Some are descendants of Boreas or the Snow Queen (a few having both parents), but they are also born to frost giants and thursir. A few result from tearful pleas by pregnant women lost in the snows, desperate to keep their newborn child from freezing to death—the fraughashar carry these infants away and raise them as ice maidens.   **Solitary Lives.** Most ice maidens live solitary existences save for a servant or two under their thrall. They’re lonely creatures, desperate for love but condemned to know companionship only through their magical kiss. If genuine love ever fills an ice maiden’s heart, she’ll melt into nothingness.   **Killing Dilemma.** An ice maiden’s hunger for affection and human contact leads them to harm those they approach, which only drives them harder to seek for warmth, love, and approval. Some claim an ice maiden can become a swan maiden or a dryad if she keeps a lover’s heart warm for a full year.</description>

Sent to consume the souls of those worshiping gods of light, these beings of shadow and sand labored slowly through corruption of the soul rather than outright war.   **Imprisoned Shadow Demons.** The corrupted ancient tribes and their priests began worshiping them as gods, and they forsook their master’s purpose to revel in their pride and vanity until they were struck down for their treachery. They have since wasted to a shadow remnant and been imprisoned in stony idols that barely cling to solidity.   **Constructed Nature.** An idolic deity doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies of their god-king willingly accompanied their dying lords into the afterlife through a horrifying transformation. Still alive, they are tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among a swarm of flesh‑eating scarabs that, over a period of days to weeks, fully consumed their bodies. The servant’s devotion to their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on the imy-ut’s duty.   **Scarab Mummies.** From a distance, the imy-ut ushabti are indistinguishable from the mummified form of their master, betrayed only by the reserved ornamentation of their lacquered armor and the ripples of movement beneath their wrappings from the mass of scarabs beneath it.   **Warding Triads.** Traditionally, imy‑ut ushabti appear only in triads—the warden, charged with ensuring the death sleep of their god‑queen is uninterrupted; the steward, tasked with escorting their master back from the land of the dead; and the herald, proclaiming their lord’s return to the world of the living.</description>

The grapple ends, but the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the isonade, and it takes 36 (8d8) acid damage at the start of each of the isonade's turns. An isonade can have two Large, four Medium, or six Small creatures swallowed at a time. If the isonade takes 40 damage or more from a swallowed creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of the isonade. If the isonade dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

  <description>_The isonade’s gargantuan thrashing tail is lined with cruelly hooked barbs, and it delights in destruction. When it approaches a coastal village, its tail shoots high into the air from beneath the waves, and it smashes all ships, docks, and nets in its path._   **Coastal Destroyer.** The isonade is a beast of destruction, sweeping away entire islands and villages. It wrecks seaside communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles, grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.   **Ocean Sacrifices.** When coastal villagers suffered from a hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.   **Enormous Age and Size.** The isonade is more than 45 feet long. The beast’s age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell some version of the legend—some believe it is the last of its kind, others believe that a small group of isonade remains.</description>

  <description>_This small dragon has feathered wings on its forearms and powerful legs it uses to cling to trees._   The jaculus (plural jaculi), is a draconic predator that roams the forest and jungle looking for valuable objects it can add to its hoard. Also called the javelin snake, a jaculus loves shiny or reflective items, and it is clever enough to identify items of real value. It will fight and kill to take items it desires, which it stashes inside hollow trees far from any forest trail.   **Leapers.** Jaculi are far better jumpers than flyers. They can jump 18 feet horizontally or 12 feet vertically after taking a single 2-foot step. They even climb faster than they fly, so they use their wings to flap clumsily back into the trees only when necessary.   **Teamwork Thievery.** Jaculi are among the least intelligent of the dragons—but they’re still smarter than most humans, and they’re known to pursue cunning and complicated plots to build their hoards. Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in the southern forests working as teams to separate merchants and other travelers from their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with gems and jewelry before the owners even know they’ve been robbed. Some jaculi may feign docility or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon as they can steal what they’re really after.</description>

  <description>_Combining the head of a goat and the body of a monkey makes the creature odd enough; combining the social grace of a baboon with pretensions of a scholar makes it more comical than threatening._   Fiendish pests that infest derelict wizards’ towers and laboratories, the kalkes are either the by-product of botched gates into the lower realms or the personification of an evil deity’s contempt for wizards. All kalkes act with the arrogance of magi while having the social characteristics of baboons. Being of fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and require neither food nor drink. Though lacking any formal spellcasting ability, all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.   **Hoard Magical Paraphernalia.** The drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose, the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to distinguish what’s magically useful from what isn’t, they grab any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover. Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.   **Perform Rituals.** Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns, and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal events, the kalkes gather to perform—by way of dance, chant, and sacrifice—an imagined rite of great magic. The effort has an equal chance of achieving nothing whatsoever, causing dangerous but short-lived misfortunes (snakes raining on the countryside, creatures summoned from the lower planes), or triggering calamities (great fires or floods).   An additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than 13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously gated to the nearest location of magical activity—often hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no control over their displacement, it’s not surprising to find them in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of some long-lost wizard.   **Hagglers.** The kalkes will return the goods they've taken, in exchange for a ransom or fee. These exchanges need to have the outward appearance of being impressively in the kalke’s favor. A particularly generous (or devious) spellcaster may be able to reach an accommodation with a persistent local troop of kalkes.</description>

    <name>Hidey-Hole</name>
    <text>When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she scrawls a symbol on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or semi-permanent object (like a stove) to be her tiny domain. This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space. Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil.</text>

  <description>_This strange-looking humanoid combines the features of an old crone and some manner of bird. A shawl covers her head but cannot contain her prominent beak and clawed hands. Her skirt reveals bird-like feet._   **Filthy Illusions.** Kikimoras are devious house spirits who torment those they live with unless they are catered to and cajoled. They delight in harassing homeowners with their illusions, making a house look much filthier than it actually is. Their favored illusions include mold, filth, and scuttling vermin.   They love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They then convince the house’s residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.   **Brownie Hunters.** Kikimoras hate brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras bring pain and frustration on their housemates instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along. Some brownies seek out kikimora‑infested homes with the intention of evicting them.   If homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or cannot rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Many times inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora believe it is haunted.   **Fast Talkers.** While they try to avoid notice and aren’t great talespinners, kikimoras are convincing and use this influence to gain an upper hand—or to evade capture or avoid violence.</description>

  <description>More than anything, kobolds are survivors.

They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.   _**Underworld Merchants.**_ Kobolds are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.   Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.   _This slight, reptilian humanoid is bedecked with ceramic flasks and glass vials. An acrid reek follows in the creature’s wake._   Kobold alchemists are usually smelled before they are seen, thanks to the apothecary’s store of chemicals and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid alchemy shops and magical laboratories to gather more material to fuel their reckless experiments.   _**Dangerous Assets.**_ Alchemists can be a great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only do the alchemists require rare, expensive, and often dangerous substances to ply their trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their experiments yield powerful weapons and defensive concoctions that can save many kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an experiment gone awry can be terrible.</description>

These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe’s trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.   _**Living Legend.**_ A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe’s greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.</description>

  <description>More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.   _**Underworld Merchants.**_ Kobolds are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.   Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.   _This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers. All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs and twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles._   Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts. These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world, and those that don’t meet an early demise through accident or violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.   _**Shifting Peril.**_ Trapsmiths aren’t warriors; they avoid direct confrontation with enemies that aren’t mired in traps or engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape.   A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders, along tunnels and paths they’ve already cleared and believe to be safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.</description>

  <description>_The kongamato is an evolutionary holdover, a large pterodactyl with avian traits, such as emergent feathers and long, beaklike jaws._   **Boat Breaker.** Its name means "breaker of boats," and as that implies, this creature systematically destroys the small vessels of those who come too close to its perch. No one knows what motivates this form of attack, although some sages suppose that the kongamato mistakes canoes for large prey like hippopotami or crocodiles.   **Spoken in Whispers.** For some tribes, kongamatos present a terrible threat, and they speak in whispers about them, fearing that mention of the beasts could attract their wrath. In some cases, evil priests and cultists summon these beasts as their servitors and use them to terrify villagers.   **Maneaters.** Kongamatos that have eaten human flesh develop a preference for it. These maneaters perform nightly raids on small towns, snatching children and Small humanoids with their claws and flying away.</description>

    <name>Koschei's Lair Actions</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Koschei takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Koschei can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Koschei creates a whirlwind centered on a point he can see within 100 feet. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it's created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage from the buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.

- Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

- Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair. Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creature other than a fiend who targets Koschei with a spell must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature still casts the spell, but it must target a creature other than Koschei.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Regional Effects</name>
    <text>the region containing Koschei's lair is warped by Koschei's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Rabbits, ducks, and other game animals become hostile toward intruders within 5 miles of the lair. They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.

- Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.

- Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster's class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.

if Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

    <text>The kot bayun puts creatures to sleep with its haunting melody. While a kot bayun sings, it can target one hearing creature within a 100-foot radius. This target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or fall asleep. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Each round the kot bayun maintains its song, it can select a new target. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the effect of that kot bayun's song for 24 hours. The slumbering song even affects elves, but they have advantage on the Charisma saving throw.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_This oddly colored cat appears at first to be a powerful panther. Its wide mouth pulls into something like a human grin, and its knowing eyes hint at intelligence beyond that of a typical predator._   Enemies of elves and blink dogs, kot bayuns are magical hunting cats gifted with eloquent speech and cunning abilities.   **Speaking Fey Cats.** These brutal and temperamental creatures get along well with cruel-minded fey. More gentle fey rightfully find the creatures to be a menace. A kot bayun measures six feet long and weighs over 200 lb. They are long-lived, and some stories record the same kot bayun in a region for over 400 years.   **Sing to Sleep.** In addition to their stealthy natures and physical prowess, kot bayun have the ability to put prey to sleep with song. They carefully choose victims and stalk them for a time, learning their strengths and weaknesses before making their attack. They lay in wait until their prey is vulnerable and then begin their slumbering song. Those resisting the call to slumber are always the kot bayun’s first victims as they launch from cover and attempt to disembowel their prey. In forests with a thick canopy, a kot bayun stealthily creeps among tree limbs, tracking the movement of its prey below.   **Healing Poetry.** If discovered by intelligent prey, a kot bayun opens with a parley instead of claws. In rare cases, a kot bayun finds something in its prey it likes and cold predation turns to a lukewarm association.   Befriending a kot bayun has benefits as the creature’s poems, tales, and sagas have the magical ability to heal negative conditions. A kot bayun tells its stories in the form of strange epics and poetry, ranging from simple rhyming folk poems to complex sonnets. This ability is not widely known (a secret the creatures intend to keep), but, as folktales spread, more and more adventurers and sages seek out these elusive beasts.</description>

Unlike krakens and giant squid, krake spawn can scuttle onto land._   **Demonic Crossbreeds.** Some believe krake spawn are demonic crossbreeds created by the aboleth, fusing kraken blood with demonic souls. Others say that krake spawn are the horrible creation of a long-forgotten meddling god, summoned to the mortal world by deep ones. Certainly krake spawn do respond to summoning magic, and sorcerers do summon krake spawn through blood sacrifices to work evil in the world. However, they do so at considerable peril: unlike demons and devils, krake spawn are seldom bound by pacts of any kind.   **Outwit Humans.** Though enormous and carrying an armored green shell on their six spindly legs, krake spawn are surprisingly quick and agile. Worse, they have a malicious and bloodthirsty intellect. A krake spawn is considerably smarter than most humans, who mistake them for dumb beasts—an error that can often prove fatal.   **Iceberg Fortresses.** Krake spawn live in remote, icy regions, where they fashion elaborate iceberg fortresses. When they venture into warmer climes in search of magic or slaves, they can preserve their icebergs with ice storms. These fortresses are stocked with frozen creatures (an emergency food supply), the krake spawn’s treasure and library, slaves or prisoners of many races, and a hellish nest filled with the krake spawn’s offspring.   A krake spawn measures 40 feet in length and weighs 2,000 lb.</description>

  <description>_This cat-sized drake with a waxy appearance and a glow emanating from its belly can hover in midair, filling a small area with a warm glow._   The lantern drake is named for its belly, which glows with a warm light. The beast's yellow, waxy scales darken with age, though lantern drakes rarely live more than 50 years or so. They weigh from 5 to 10 pounds and are 18 inches long. Most believe they are the result of an arcane fusion of a radiant spirit with a paper drake.   **Eat Candle Wax.** The drake devours four ounces of candle wax per day, plus four more ounces if it uses its belly lantern. A lantern dragonette’s unusual diet leads it to lair in libraries, abbeys, and other places of study. Even though the dragonettes eat candles essential for study during dark hours, they still provide light and protect their adopted homes. Residents and caretakers consider them good luck and enjoy conversing with them.   **Telepathic Chatterbox.** This gregarious drake prefers to speak with its companions but uses telepathy if necessary, and the creature hisses when surprised or displeased. It loves nothing more than discussing magic and history with an intelligent and informed individual.   **Adventurous Companions.** Occasionally, a dragonette wishing to learn more about the world finds a spellcaster or adventuring party to travel with, purely for the sake of learning or to acquire new sources of knowledge. Most parties enjoy the traveling light source and the abilities these companions bring to bear. A lantern dragonette avoids combat and uses its abilities only to escape or to defend its lair, family, and friends.   A dragonette lives up to 30 years. A mated pair produces one clutch of two to five eggs every five years, and one parent raises the young dragonettes until they mature after a year and leave to search for their own lairs. A cloister of lantern dragonettes taxes their lair’s resources, so the other parent often ventures out to retrieve more candles.</description>

  <description>_This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees, gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two intelligent, bulbous eyes._   **Jungle Rulers.** These small, intelligent, squirrel-like humanoids live in reclusive, primitive societies deep in the jungle. They are omnivorous, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They sometimes barter with more advanced creatures for metal and crafted items.   **Nocturnal Gliders.** Lemurfolk are nocturnal, though they can adopt daytime hours when they must. They prefer to hunt and move by gliding between trees, catching prey off guard.   **Greyfur Elders.** Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered kaguani, as much as 80 years old; their age can be estimated by the graying of their fur, but they don’t track the years. Greyfurs are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though they rarely pursue the art of necromancy—a strong taboo prohibits them from interacting with the dead.

  <description>_A leshy is a strange man wearing loose scraps of clothing and covered in bark and root-like growths. The hair and beard that frame his piercing green eyes writhe like living vines._   **Expanding the Wild.** Solitary leshy tend plants and animals in groves around great forests, and they are the self-proclaimed protectors of the forest outskirts. Leshy have little patience for interlopers and often kill, abduct, or frighten off trailblazers and guides. With their plant growth ability, they sabotage cultivated land, wipe out trails, and create weed walls and thickets to keep civilization at bay. Using speak with plants, they transplant dangerous plant creatures to discourage new settlements. Some have wrangled rabid animals to the same purpose.   **Ax Thieves.** Leshy prefer trickery to combat, particularly enjoying leading interlopers astray through use of their mimicry. If challenged, they use their ability to change size to scare intruders away, but they never hesitate to fight to the death in service to the forest if necessary. Leshy hate metal, especially axes, and they go out of their way to steal metal items and lead those who use them astray.   **Accept Bribes.** With careful courting and appropriate gifts, it is possible to gain a leshy’s capricious assistance. This can be risky, because leshy love mischief. Still, at times a leshy’s help is essential to a group traversing ancient woodlands.</description>

The eye is usually donated by one of the institution’s scholars (prescribed in their will) so that they can continue serving the repositories of knowledge that were their life’s work.   **Telekinetic.** While the automatons have no arms, they can move and manipulate written materials telekinetically. Powered by keen analytical engines, the library automaton tirelessly pores through tomes, translates ancient texts, catalogs the institution’s volumes, fetches texts for visitors, and occasionally rids the vast halls of uninvited pests.   **Sought by Wizards.** Wizards have discovered that these clockwork bureaucrats make particularly effective caretakers for their spellbooks and scrolls while on adventure.   **Constructed Nature.** A library automaton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Creatures that successfully save against this effect cannot be affected by a lich hound's howl for 24 hours.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_Their howls echoing from another plane, lich hounds always arrive wreathed in mist. Half bone, half purple fire, they are creatures of hunger and the hunt. Nothing makes them happier than taking down creatures larger than themselves—or racing through the air to catch a surprised bat in mid-flight. All cruelty and fang, lich hounds are most satisfied when praised by their great undead lords._   **Fiery Bones.** Bright white skulls with a heavy jaw and thick, robust skeletal bodies define the ferocious lich hounds. Their eyes burn green or blue, and their tongues resemble black fire. Fueled by necromantic power, these creatures are loyal servants of either ghoul high priests or liches.   **Echoing Howls.** Even on their own, lich hounds are relentless hunters, pursuing their prey with powerful senses and a keen ability to find the living wherever they may hide. Lich hound howls fade into and out of normal hearing, with strangely shifted pitch and echoes.   **Murdered Celestials.** The dark process of creating a lich hound involves a perverse ritual of first summoning a celestial canine and binding it to the Material Plane. The hound’s future master then murders the trapped beast. Only then can the creature be animated in all its unholy glory. Hound archons have long been outraged by the creation of lich hounds, and they occasionally band together to rid the world of those who practice this particular dark magic.   **Undead Nature.** A lich hound doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Malformed like a goblin, this creature bears one large, strange eye in the middle of its face. It wears dark and dirty rags, and its spindly claws and arms match its hunched torso._   **Ferocious Attitude.** Likho are scrappy fighters; they weaken foes from afar with their magical attacks to curse and enfeeble enemies, then rush forward in a blazing charge and jump onto their foes, shredding them with their claws. Once a likho has leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its hands and feet.   **Jeers and Insults.** A likho uses its message spells to taunt and jeer its target from a distance during the hunt. In addition, to flinging curses and ill luck, likho frustrate and infuriate their enemies because they are difficult to hit. A likho enjoys stalking intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.   **Organ Eaters.** Likho thrive when they drain away luck and aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the creature’s abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid’s organs and leaves the rest of the carcass behind.</description>

  <description>_The curtain of rippling colors assumes a humanoid form. Its kaleidoscope body shifts and glitters with mesmeric patterns._   Sometimes known as “light elves” because they assume a vaguely elfish shape, these enigmatic shapeshifters make their home at the edge of the world, where reality bends and physical laws unravel. Their mutable bodies are composed entirely of shifting colors. Among themselves they communicate through flashing patterns and hues, but they talk to other races in an echoing, choral tone that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere around them.   **Servants of Fate.** Their aims often seem inconsequential or simply baffling, but they’ve also sundered mountains and toppled kingdoms. Many believe they’re agents of Fate, others that their motivation is an alien aesthetic or their own amusement.   **Pattern Vision.** Those who’ve spoken with liosalfar say they talk as if all existence was a sea of patterns and colors to be set in pleasing shapes. They barely understand mortal concerns.   **Enemies of the Ramag.** The liosalfar have a longstanding rivalry with the portal-making ramag, whom they despise as “corruptors of the patterns.”   **Elemental Nature.** A liosalfar doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_A living wick is a small, rough wax sculpture of a human that stands at attention, a halo of light flickering around its head from some source behind it._   **Enchanted Wicks.** Living wicks are obedient wax statues brought to life by an enchanted wick that runs from the nape of their neck to their lower back. When new, a living wick looks and moves like a human, but as the wick burns, the wax features melt and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.   **Short-Lived as a Candle.** Living wicks are powered by flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle. They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but some say a living wick’s affordability more than makes up for its inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle.   Living wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic.   **Explosive Ends.** The amount of magical energy contained within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it is released, gives them a remarkable capability for selfdestruction. If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.   **Constructed Nature.** A living wick doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Lounging on large river rocks or within swirling eddies untouched by the rush of the current, these breathtakingly fey call plaintively to travelers and knights errant. They seek nothing less than the last breath of a drowning man._   **Death to Men.** These callous river sirens compete with one another in manipulating and destroying male travelers. A lorelei often taunts her prey for days before finally turning on it. When the opportunity presents itself, it quickly draws heavily armored warriors into deep water and kisses them as they drown.   **Voluptuous Humanoids.** Although legends describe the lorelei as golden-haired and fair-skinned, they come in all varieties, each more voluptuous than the next. While most resemble sensual humans, a lorelei’s form can also include elves, dwarves, and in some recorded cases even orcs and hobgoblins—a lorelei mimics her most frequent prey.   **Ignore Women.** Women travelers are vexing for the lorelei. While the siren’s powers affect women as readily as men, the lorelei lacks the urge to destroy them. Women traveling alone or in all-female groups may pass through a lorelei’s territory safely, and might even make peaceful contact. However, women who protect male companions are viewed as traitors, inspiring wrath.</description>

  <description>_Often called elephant centaurs by humans and gnolls, loxodas are massive creatures that combine the torso of an ogre and the body of an elephant. Hating and fearing all strangers, they live in open plains and scrubland._   **Nomadic Families.** Loxodas live in small herds of 2-3 extended families. Several of these communities will usually cluster together, allowing members to move between groups as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the available food. Voracious eaters, a family of loxodas will quickly strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant. They devour both meat and vegetation.   **Often Underestimated.** Many people assume that loxodas are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal mistake, as the elephant centaurs are quite intelligent. Their simple equipment and straightforward living comes not from a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body makes it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently reject communications and trade with other people. The little metal they can gather is either taken from the bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven, human, or gnoll settlements.   **Vestigial Tusks.** All loxodas have curved tusks. While they are too small for use in even ritual combat, they are often decorated with intricate carvings, inlays or dyed in a pattern developed by their family. Each individual also adapts the patterns with their own individual marks, often inspired by important events in their lives. Some loxodas put golden rings or jewelled bracelets stolen from humanoids onto their tusks as trophies—a loxoda matriarch may have long dangling chains of such ornaments, indicating her high status and long life. They stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 20,000 pounds.</description>

  <description>_“I saw no more terrible beast on all my journeys north than the mahoru. The white bears had their aloof majesty, the lindwurm serpentine grace, but the monster that gnawed away the pack ice beneath our feet and savaged any who fell into the water was a thing of nightmare. The men it snatched were torn apart, like rags in the mouth of a rabid dog.”_   A hybrid of fish and mammal, a mahoru is eight feet long and looks like a small orca with a serpentine neck and seal-like head.   **Valuable Teeth and Fur.** Their heavy jaws are filled with triangular, serrated teeth adept at tearing flesh and sundering bone. Their white and black fur is highly prized for its warmth and waterproof qualities. Their pectoral fins feature stubby, claw-tipped paws. Skraeling use the mahoru’s fangs to make arrowheads or tooth-studded clubs, and the mahoru is a totem beast for many northern tribes.   **Iceberg Hunters.** Relatives of the bunyip, mahoru prowl northern coasts and estuaries, hunting among the fragmenting pack ice each summer. They lurk beneath the surface, catching swimmers chunks or lurching up onto the ice to break or tilt it and send prey tumbling into the water. When necessary, they stalk beaches and riverbanks in search of carrion or unwary victims.   **Work in Pairs and Packs.** Mahoru work together in mated pairs to corral everything from fish and seals to larger prey like kayaking humans and even polar bears. They gnaw at ice bridges and the frozen surface of lakes and rivers to create fragile patches that plunge unwary victims into their waiting jaws.</description>

  <description>_This tiny monstrosity combines the worst elements of a dead frog and a rotting fish. Its slimy, scaly, vaguely humanoid form has three clawed arms arranged radially about its body. Its slimy green bat‑like wings seem too small to work, yet it flies very well._   **Twisted Field Sprites.** Mamuras are the twisted faeries of magical wastelands and barren plains. They were once goodaligned, pixie-like fey called “polevoi,” or “field sprites,” but at some point they swore their souls to a dark goddess and were corrupted by her foul magic. Now they are twisted, alien things.   **Cross-Dimensional.** The mamura is one degree out of phase with the usual five dimensions. As a result, it always appears blurry and indistinct even in bright light, and it seems translucent in dim light.   Mamuras babble constantly, but their talk is mostly nonsense. Their minds operate in multiple dimensions in time as well as space, and this allows them to talk to creatures of the Realms Beyond. Because of this, their babble may be prophetic, but only few can decipher it.   **Prophetic Followers.** They occasionally align themselves with powerful goblin tribes or evil wasteland sorcerers for their own unknowable purposes.</description>

  <description>_The frame of this withered demon’s corpse barely fills the ash-colored plate armor that encases it. It carries a serrated khopesh sword in spiked gauntlets that hiss with violet smoke, and a horned ivory mask devoid of features is nailed to its face._   **Children of Fiends.** Long ago, a demon lord of shadow and deceit fell in love with a demon goddess of destruction. At the base of a crater left by a meteor that destroyed a civilization, the two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but wholly expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other. Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.   **Rites of Annihilation.** To create these undead, the lord of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich. Then, the goddess of the underworld sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence into ivory masks—one for each fiend the couple sought to annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.   When they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from memory and history.   **Ready for Betrayal.** Kept secret from one another, though, the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in case betrayal should cross their lover’s mind.   **Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Mi-go have been described as “vaguely insectlike,” but the emphasis belongs on “vaguely.” They have stubby wings, multiple limbs, and nightmarish heads, but the resemblance ends there._   The mi-go are a space-faring race of great skill and vast malevolence. They travel in large numbers between worlds, somehow folding space to cover astronomical distances in months rather than decades.   **Alien Technology.** Their technology includes mastery of living things, powerful techniques to implant mi-go elements and even minds in alien bodies (or to extract them), and an unparalleled mastery of living tissue in both plant and animal form. While they have their own secrets and goals, they also serve ancient powers from between the stars and carry on an interstellar effort to conquer and spread their species.   **World Colonizers.** The mi-go are devoted followers of Shub-Niggurath, the goddess of fecundity and growth, and take their evangelical mission extremely seriously. They colonize entire worlds in Shub-Niggurath’s name, and they plant and harvest entire species according to her will.   **Brain Cylinders.** One of the apexes of mi-go technology is the brain cylinder, a device that permits the extraction and maintenance of a living brain outside the body. Safely isolated in a mi-go cylinder, a human brain can be transported between the stars, sheltered—mostly—from the psyche-crushing effects of interstellar space. They deploy, fill, and retrieve these cylinders according to schedules and for purposes mysterious to others. Indeed, most of their technology appears either revolting or simply bizarre to humanoids (plant folk are less disquieted by their functioning).   Mi-go merchants exchange psychic tools, surgical instruments, and engineered materials such as solar wings, illuminating lampfruit, and purple starvines (which induce sleep).</description>

  <description>_The millitaur is a purplish-black segmented worm the size of a horse, with hundreds of legs, black multifaceted eyes and thick powerful mandibles. They wield crude stone axes._   **Mulch Eaters.** Millitaurs roam jungles and woodlands, where dense undergrowth rots beneath the canopy and piles high; leaves and plants provide much of the millitaur diet. Though millitaurs are territorial, they sometimes chase away threats rather than kill intruders. However, they also are good hunters and supplement their diet with squirrel, monkey, and even gnome or goblin.   **Poisonous Drool.** As formidable as they appear, millitaurs are the preferred prey of some dragons and jungle giants, and tosculi often hunt them for use as slaves and pack animals. In defense, they’ve developed a mild poison. Millitaur handaxes often drip with this substance, smeared onto them from the beast’s mandibles. They use their axes for breaking up mulch for easier digestion, as well as using them for hunting and self-defense.   **Clicking Speech.** Millitaurs communicate via body language, antennae movements, scent, and clicking sounds. Although they have no voice boxes, millitaurs can make sounds by artfully clicking and grinding their mandibles, and they can mimic the sounds of Common in a peculiar popping tone. They can be good sources for local information so long as they are treated with respect and their territory is not encroached.</description>

  <description>_A heavily cloaked figure reeks of decay and spreads a floating cloud of spores with every step._   **Fungal Rot.** Mindrot fungus is an intelligent hive-mind parasite that consumes creatures from the inside out. When inhaled, mindrot spores enter the brain through the bloodstream. As the fungus grows, it dissolves the host’s body and slowly replaces the creature’s flesh with its own.   The fungus’s first target is the motor function of the brain. It takes control of the creature’s movement while the victim is still alive and fully conscious—but no longer controls his or her own body! Indeed, sensory awareness may be the last function that the fungus attacks. Eventually, even the victim’s skin and muscle are replaced with fungal fibers. At that point, the affected creature no longer looks like its former self. Such a newly-born mindrot thrall conceals its alarming appearance under heavy robes or cloaks so it can travel without causing alarm.   **Spore Blisters.** A thrall’s skin is taut and waxy. Blisters form just beneath the surface, and when they grow as large as a child’s fist they burst, releasing a spray of spores. It seeks to infect as many new victims as possible during the few weeks that it survives in humanoid form. At the end of that time, the thrall shrivels to a dried, vaguely humanoid husk. Even a dead mindrot thrall, however, is still dangerous because its half-formed spore blisters can remain infectious for months. Disturbing the husk can burst these blisters and trigger a Mindrot Spores attack.   **Dimensional Horrors.** Wizards hypothesize the fungus was brought to the mortal world by a shambling horror crossing through a dimensional portal. The remoteness of that wasteland is likely whythe mindrot fungus hasn’t destroyed whole cities, though someday it may find a more fertile breeding ground.</description>

    <name>Captivating Dance (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest, Humanoid Form Only)</name>
    <text>The mirager performs a sinuously swaying dance. Humanoids within 20 feet that view this dance must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and charmed by the mirager for 1 minute. Humanoids of all races and genders have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this mirager's dance for the next 24 hours.</text>

  <description>_This lovely lass is clad in diaphanous veils and a revealing skirt, and she shows graceful skill while dancing through the dust._   **Humanoid Sand.** In its natural form, a mirager resembles a shifting mass of sand and dust with a vaguely humanoid shape, crumbling away like a sandcastle in the wind.   **Enticing Illusion.** A mirage can take on the guise of a lovely man or woman with luminous eyes, delicate features, and seductive garments. Whether male or female, a mirager dresses in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.   **Thirst for Blood.** Whatever its apparent form, a mirager’s existence is one of unnatural and endless thirst. They hunger for flesh and thirst for blood, and they draw especial pleasure from leeching a creature’s fluids in the throes of passion. A victim is drained into a lifeless husk before the mirager feasts on the dehydrated remains.</description>

  <description>_The creature emerging from the shadows of the swamp is short and lean. Its pale-skinned body is covered in fungus and moss that seems to grow directly in its flesh, and its green eyes weep bloody tears._   Miremals are savage, degenerate fey who delight in crafting seemingly safe paths through treacherous swamps—though these paths are, instead, riddled with traps and ambush points.   **Unreliable Guides.** Miremals hunt in packs of three to six and often serve a more powerful creature, especially one that commands potent magic. As a result, many of these paths lead unwary travelers into the grove of a green hag coven or into the lair of a black dragon.   **Swamp.** Miremals have adapted from sylvan forests to the swamps: patches of red and green fungus sprout from their skin, mushrooms and branches grow haphazardly out of their bodies, and moss hangs from beneath their arms. Their eyes are forest green and are perpetually wet with bloody tears—their legends say their tears come from rage over their banishment and agony from knowing they can never return.   **Hate Moss Lurkers.** Miremals are occasionally confused with moss lurkers, but the two despise one another and both consider the comparison odious.</description>

  <description>_Tiny wisps of grayish smoke ooze from the slate-colored coat of this leonine beast._   **Ethereal Lions.** The elusive mngwa (MING-wah; “the strange ones”) are the offspring of a sentient feline beast from the Ethereal Plane that mated with a lioness long ago. Also called nunda (“smoke-cats”), mngwas are strong and cunning hunters that can elude pursuit or approach their prey unnoticed by disappearing into the ether for a brief time.   **Rocky Terrain.** Mngwas choose their hunting ground carefully, avoiding flatlands where competing predators are plentiful. They favor rocky and treacherous terrain where their talent for dancing along the veil between worlds allows them to easily outmaneuver their prey.   **Feline Allies.** The strongest mngwa recruit other great cats into their prides, though these associations tend to be shortlived. They hunt with especially savage groups of nkosi, though only a great pridelord can command one during a hunt. When the hunt is over, the mngwa move on, and sometimes they take one of the young nkosi with them to become a shaman.</description>

  <description>_This suit of armor stands motionless, its visor raised to reveal a black skull with eyes cold as a winter moon. A cloak of owl feathers hangs from its shoulders, and a greatsword is slung across its back._   **Beautiful Constructs.** Monolithic servitors are constructs designed to serve the courts of the shadow fey. As constructs go, these are uncommonly beautiful; they are meant to be as pleasing to the eyes as they are functional. Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder, and what’s beautiful in the eyes of the shadow fey might be considered strange, disturbing, or even alarming by mortal folk.   **Expensive Armor.** Regardless of a viewer’s esthetic opinion, it’s obvious that a monolith champion incorporates amazing workmanship. Every fitting is perfect; every surface is masterfully burnished and etched with detail almost invisible to the naked eye or decorated with macabre inlays and precious chasing. The skull in the helmet is mere decoration, meant to frighten the weak of heart and mislead opponents into thinking the champion is some form of undead rather than a pure construct.   **Keeping Out the Rabble.** As its name implies, the monolith champion serves as a guardian, warrior, or sentry. In those roles, it never tires, never becomes distracted or bored, never questions its loyalty, and never swerves from its duty. It delights in throwing non-fey visitors out of fey settlements and buildings.   **Constructed Nature.** A monolith champion doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Mordant snares were created by war mages of ancient times. Each resembles an immense, dark gray, 11-armed starfish weighing eight tons, and yet a mordant snare is never obvious. Instead, it controls a few humanoids shuffling about aimlessly, their skin glistening with moisture, occasionally forming loose groups near the snare. These puppets pay little attention to their surroundings._   **Starfish Puppet Masters.** Snares bury themselves under loose soil to attack creatures walking above them. They attack by extruding filaments that inject acid into victims; this liquefies organs and muscle while leaving the skeleton, tendons, and skin intact. With the body thus hollowed out and refilled with acid and filaments, the mordant snare can control it from below like a puppet, creating a group of awkward, disoriented people. New victims fall prey to mordant snares when they approach to investigate.   **Brains Preferred.** The mordant snare prefers intelligent food. With its tremorsense, it can easily distinguish between prey; it prefers Small and Medium bipeds. A mordant snare hunts an area until it is empty, so a village can suffer tremendous losses or even be wiped out before discovering what’s happening. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels, and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks a new home.   **Cooperative Killers.** Mordant snares are few in number and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost long ago, eventually they will disappear forever—until then, they cooperate well with each other, using puppets to lure victims to one another. A team is much more dangerous than a lone snare, and when three or more link up, they are especially deadly.</description>

  <description>_These blue-skinned humanoids wield tridents and have unusual faces with vertical eyes but no mouth or nose._   **Shapeshifter Plants.** Morphoi are shape-shifting plant creatures indigenous to many islands. In their natural forms, the morphoi are androgynous beings between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their elliptical heads have eyes on both front and back. When harmed, they bleed a dark red sap.   As plants, the morphoi don’t need to eat. Instead, they gather nutrients from the sun and air. When posing as humanoids, they consume small amounts of food to aid their disguise, but since they have no internal digestive system, the food is just stored inside their bodies until they can spit it out.   **Ship Travel.** Morphoi live in island communities and in nearby waters. Many travel by ship—usually by posing as beautiful women, handsome men, or stranded travelers. They harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and their disguised agents are behind many otherwise inexplicable acts of sabotage and murder. Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can’t mimic specific individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing backgrounds to go along with their disguises.   **Four Eyes Always.** No matter what form they shift into, morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).   About one in 30 morphoi are chieftains, and they have rangers, shamans, and warlocks among them. Those chosen as infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the two species to interbreed.</description>

  <description>_Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, the moss lurkers are a primitive race of forest and cavern dwellers with long, greenish beards and hair. Their hides are mossy green or peaty amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds them at all times._   Like their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large and often grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed, and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or ferns as primitive camouflage.   **Rocks and Large Weapons.** Moss lurkers have a fondness for throwing stones onto enemies from a great height, and they often employ enormous axes, warhammers, and two-handed swords that seem much larger than such a small creature should be able to lift.</description>

    <name>Selket's Venom</name>
    <text>The venomous mummy's body and wrappings are magically imbued with substances that are highly toxic. Any creature that comes in physical contact with the venomous mummy (e.g., touching the mummy barehanded, grappling, using a bite attack) must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned with Selket's venom. The poisoned target takes 3 (1d6) poison damage every 10 minutes. Selket's venom is a curse, so it lasts until ended by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Toxic Smoke</name>
    <text>The venomous mummy's poison-imbued wrappings and flesh create toxic fumes when burned. If a venomous mummy takes fire damage, it is surrounded by a cloud of toxic smoke in a 10-foot radius. This cloud persists for one full round. A creature that starts its turn inside the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 14 (4d6) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.</text>

  <description>_This shambling corpse warrior is draped in stained linen wrappings. Green liquid drips from rents in the fabric._   **Servant of the Scorpion Goddess.** These mummies are crafted by Selket’s faithful to guard holy sites and tombs and to serve as agents of the goddess’s retribution. Should Selket or her faithful feel themselves slighted by an individual or a community, they perform dangerous rituals to awaken these creatures from the crypts of her temples. Venomous mummies delight in wreaking deadly vengeance against those who disrespect the goddess.   **Death to Blasphemers.** In most cases, retribution is limited to people who actually undertook the acts of blasphemy, but if her priests determine that an entire community has grown heretical and earned Selket’s wrath, they may set mummies loose against the entire populace.   **Deadly Smoke.** Burning a venomous mummy is a terrible idea; the smoke of their immolation is toxic.</description>

  <description>_Deathcap flesh ranges from white to pale gray to a warm yelloworange. Their heads resemble fungal caps, often either red with white spots, red at the center with a brown edge, or a bluish-purple tone. Although deathcaps have vicious-looking fanged mouths, they use them only to ingest earth or mineral nutrients._   **Mushroom Farmers.** These sentient mushroom folk tend the white forests of fungi in the underworld and are allies of the darakhul. Despite their ominous name, deathcap myconids are chiefly farmers. They cultivate dozens of species of mushrooms anywhere they have water, dung, and a bit of earth or slime in the underworld deeps. For this reason, other races rarely attack them. The ghouls do not eat them, and they cannot be made into darakhul.   **Toxic Spores.** Although deathcaps are mostly peaceful, their spores are toxic and sleep-inducing. They make excellent allies in combat because their abilities tend to punish attackers, but they aren’t especially lethal on their own. They use their poison and slumber spores to full effect against living creatures; they typically flee from constructs and undead. They count on their allies (carrion beetles, darakhul, purple worms, dark creepers, or even various devils) to fend off the most powerful foes.   **Clones.** Deathcap myconids live in communal groups of related clones. They reproduce asexually, and an elder and its offspring can be nearly identical in all but age. These clone groups are called deathcap rings.   Myconids build no huts or towns, but their groups are defined by their crops and general appearance. Indeed, many sages claim that the deathcaps are merely the fruiting, mobile bodies of the forests they tend, and that this is why they fight so ferociously to defend their forests of giant fungi.</description>

    <text>If the myling starts its turn on its chosen burial ground, it sinks into the earth. If it has a creature grappled, that creature sinks with the myling. A Medium or larger creature sinks up to its waist; a Small creature sinks up to its neck. If the myling still has the victim grappled at the start of the myling's next turn, both of them disappear into the earth. While buried this way, a creature is considered stunned. It can free itself with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but only one check is allowed; if it fails, the creature is powerless to aid itself except with magic. The creature must also make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; if it succeeds, the creature has a lungful of air and can hold its breath for (Constitution modifier + 1) minutes before suffocation begins. Otherwise, it begins suffocating immediately. Allies equipped with digging tools can reach it in four minutes divided by the number of diggers; someone using an improvised tool (a sword, a plate, bare hands) counts as only one-half of a digger.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_Mylings are the souls of the unburied, those who died in the forest from abandonment or exposure and can find no peace until their bodies are properly interred. Given the circumstances around their deaths, mylings tend to be solitary. They haunt the places where they died. When some tragedy resulted in multiple deaths, the resulting mylings stay together and hunt as a pack._   **Attack in a Rage.** Mylings prefer to attack lone wanderers, but they target a group when desperate or when there’s more than one myling in the pack. They shadow a target until after dark, then jump onto the target’s back and demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim’s shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings will bite victims to death if they are unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim moves too slowly.   **Ungrateful Rest.** While all mylings seek a creature to carry them to their final resting place, even when a chosen “mount” is willing to carry the myling, the creature’s body grows immensely heavier as it nears its burial place. Once there, it sinks into the earth, taking its bearers with it. Being buried alive is their reward for helping the myling.   **Urchin Rhymes and Songs.** Some mylings maintain traces of the personalities they had while alive— charming, sullen, or sadistic—and they can speak touchingly and piteously. Dressed in ragged clothing, their skin blue with cold, they sometimes reach victims who believe they are helping an injured child or young adult. They hide their faces and sing innocent rhymes when they aren’t screeching in fury, for they know that their dead eyes and cold blue skin cause fright and alarm.   **Undead Nature.** A myling doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_These drakes are resplendent in their natural form, plumed and scaled in glittering, multicolored hues.

They retain full use of their sorcerous powers in their humanoid forms, and they can retain that form indefinitely.   **Difficult to Spot.** A naina shapeshifted into human form is nearly impossible to spot as anything but human unless she makes a mistake that gives away her true nature, and they seldom do. Draconic roars, a flash of scales, a fondness for raw meat, and a flash of wrathful dragon breath are the most common tells.   **Hunted by Rumor.** When rumors of a naina circulate, any woman who is a stranger may be persecuted, ostracized, or even tortured unless she can prove that she’s entirely human.</description>

It takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the nightgarm's turns. A nightgarm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the nightgarm takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the nightgarm.

  <description>_These humanoid creatures work with their lupine mother and their worg and winter wolf brothers and sisters to destroy human and dwarvish settlements. Their howls are songs of vengeance, and their fangs and jaws seem ready to swallow the world._   **Champions of the Northern Packs.** Created in a magical ritual performed over a pregnant worg by her packmates, nightgarms are always female and are always loyal followers of Fenris. They are dedicated to harassing servants of the gods, especially the northern gods of the sky, thunder, or wisdom. Their spawn infiltrate settlements to bring them down—treachery that always ends with a massed attack by wolves.   **Carry Off Plunder.** Nightgarms resemble enormous wolves, but up close their wide mouths, hate-filled eyes, and half-formed fingers give them away as something different from—and much worse than— worgs. They can wield items in their front paws and can walk on their hind limbs when necessary, though they are far swifter on four legs.   **Impossibly Wide Jaws.** A nightgarm’s jaws can open to swallow corpses, living creatures, and items larger than themselves, a magical trick that happens in a matter of seconds.</description>

  <description>_With a thick mane of beaded locks, these powerful-looking bestial humanoids grin with a huge mouthful of pointed teeth—as befits a shapeshifter that can turn into a noble lion._   **Beads and Braids.** The nkosi resemble bestial humans with cat’s eyes, slender tails, and the fangs and fur of a lion. Most grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi’s true form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape, taking the form of a lion. Although comfortable in the wilds, nkosi can adapt to any environment.   **Clawlike Blades.** In combat, they favor curved blades, wielded in a brutal fighting style in concert with snapping lunges using their sharp teeth. They prefer light armor decorated with bone beads, fetishes, and similar tokens taken from beasts they’ve slain.   **Pridelords.** Nkosi pridelords are exceptionally tall and muscular members of the race, and they are leaders among their kin. Pridelords feature impressive manes but they are more famous for their powerful roar, which wakes the feral heart inside all members of this race.</description>

  <description>_A grinning man brandishes a staff surmounted by a rune-covered skull. Blasphemous sigils adorn his clothes, and ashes stain his skin a sickly gray._   Noctiny are wretched humanoids corrupted by fell power. Their skin is sallow and gaunt even before they smear it with ash, bone dust, and worse materials to wash all living color from their bodies. The noctiny embrace all manner of blasphemous and taboo behaviors to please their masters.   **Pyramid of Power.** The noctiny’s lust for power drives them away from decency and reason. They are initiates who form the lowest rung of fext society. They swear themselves into service to the undead fext as thugs, servants, acolytes, and cannon fodder, and in exchange draw a trickle of power for themselves.   **A Race Apart.** Though they arise from any humanoid stock, the noctiny are corrupted by the powers they serve. Noctiny retain the cosmetic traits that identify their original race if one looks hard enough, but any connection they once had to their fellows is overpowered by their transformation into noctiny.</description>

  <trait>
    <name>Swarm</name>
    <text>The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening at least 2 inches square. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.</text>
  </trait>
  <action>
    <name>Eye Extraction</name>
    <text>Every creature that occupies the same space as the swarm must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become temporarily blinded as their eyes strain from their sockets. This blindness lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in the same space as the oculus; it ends at the end of the blinded creature's turn if the creature is out of the oculus's space. Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a creature that's already temporarily blinded is targeted again by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage). Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn't recover its sight until it gets out of the swarm). An oculo swarm with 50 or fewer hit points can't use this ability.</text>
  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Gaze (recharge 5-6)</name>
    <text>The swarm targets every creature in its space with a gaze attack. The swarm can choose one of two effects for the attack: confusion or hold person. Every target in the swarm's space is affected unless it makes a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Even creatures that avert their eyes or are blind can be affected by an oculus swarm's gaze. The confusion or hold person effect lasts 1d4 rounds.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_This collection of hundreds of eyes floats along, trailing ganglia and dripping caustic fluid that sizzles when it hits the ground._   **Failed Experiment.** An oculo swarm results from an experiment to create a live scrying sensor that went poorly. Once set loose, these horrors attain a form of distributed self‑awareness. Exactly what motivates them is unknown, except that they are driven to survive.   **Flesh Stealers.** A weakened oculo swarm can reinvigorate itself by tearing fresh eyes from almost any type of living creature. If a badly depleted oculus swarm escapes from battle— and they seldom fight to the death unless cornered—it attacks lone creatures or weak groups until the mass of gore-spattered eyeballs is replenished. The more dismembered eyeballs the swarm contains, the more powerful its paralyzing resonance field becomes.   **Single Eye Scouts.** The entire swarm sees what any single member sees. Before attacking or even entering a potentially dangerous area, individual eyes scout ahead for prospective victims or dangerous foes. A lone eye has no offensive capability and only 1 hp. It can travel only 100 feet away from the main swarm, and it must return to the swarm within an hour or it dies.</description>

The creature takes no damage if the oozasis chooses not to inflict any. When the oozasis moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the oozasis.</text>

  <description>_The oasis appears as an idyllic desert respite, offering water, shade, and even perhaps edible fruit and nuts in the trees above._   **Mockmire.** The oozasis, or oasis ooze, is also known as a mockmire in other climates. It mimics a peaceful, pristine watering hole to draw in unsuspecting prey. An oozasis cycles seemingly at random between wakefulness and hibernation.   **Quest Givers.** Within its odd physiology stirs an ancient mind with an inscrutable purpose. Far from being a mere mindless sludge, its fractured intelligence occasionally awakens to read the thoughts of visitors. At these times, it tries to coerce them into undertaking quests for cryptic reasons.   **Ancient Minds.** Some tales claim these creatures preserve the memories of mad wizards from dead empires, or that they have unimaginably ancient, inhuman origins.</description>

They are frequently soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and darkness.   **Dissolve Bones.** A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large animal or small person, simply dissolving everything including the bones in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an important element of certain dark rituals.</description>

The ostinato can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the music it hears comes from an external entity. The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6) thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

The target dies if its maximum hit points are reduced to 0. Victims notice this damage immediately, but not its source.</text>

  <description>_A bit of catchy, repetitive music emanates from nowhere, drifting and moving as if dancing in the empty air._   **Born from Drama.** Incredibly moving arias, passionate performances, and ditties that drive you mad are often the product of ostinatos. These creatures of living music are born from overwrought emotions, and they feed off the vitality and personality of mortals.   **Song Searchers.** Ostinatos wander the mortal world as repetitive snippets of song, searching for hosts and rich feeding grounds. They enter hosts secretly, remaining undetected to prolong their voracious feasting as long as possible.</description>

  <description>_This squat little man has long limbs and skin the color of coal, and the backs of its hands and tops of its feet are covered in thick hair. Its face seems a bit too wide for its head, and its eyes gleam a little too brightly in the pale light._   Pomberos are strange tricksters, born of shadows in the wild. At rest, they tend to adopt a squatting posture, which accentuates their too-long limbs. They shun bright light, though it doesn’t harm them, and seek out shadows and half-light. For this reason, they are known as the Night People.   **Joy of Trespassing.** Pomberos take delight from creeping into places where they don’t belong and stealing interesting objects. A pombero’s lair is littered with trinkets, both commonplace and valuable. The blame for all manner of misfortune is laid at the pombero’s hairy feet.   **Hatred of Hunters.** In contrast to their larcenous ways, pomberos take great umbrage over the killing of animals and the destruction of trees in their forests. Birds are particularly beloved pets, and they enjoy mimicking bird songs and calls most of all. Villagers in areas near pombero territory must be careful to treat the animals and trees with respect, and killing birds usually is a strong taboo in such areas.</description>

  <description>_These shambling corpses have twigs, branches, and other debris intertwined with their bodies, and their gaping maws often crawl with scrabbling vermin._   **Swamp Undead.** Putrid haunts are walking corpses infused with moss, mud, and the detritus of the deep swamp. They are the shambling remains of individuals who, either through mishap or misdeed, died while lost in a vast swampland. Their desperate need to escape the marshland in life transforms into a hatred of all living beings in death. They often gather in places tainted by evil deeds.   **Mossy Islands.** When no potential victims are nearby, putrid haunts sink into the water and muck, where moss and water plants grow over them and vermin inhabit their rotting flesh. When living creatures draw near, the dormant putrid haunt bursts from its watery hiding spot and attacks its prey, slamming wildly with its arms and stomping on prone foes to push them deeper into the muck. There’s no planning and little cunning in their assault, but they move through the marshes more freely than most intruders and they attack with a single-mindedness that’s easily mistaken for purpose.   **Leech Harbors.** Putrid haunts create especially favorable conditions for leeches. They are often hosts or hiding places for large gatherings of leeches.   **Undead Nature.** A putrid haunt doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Animals refuse to approach within 20 feet of them.   **Goblin Mercenaries.** Qwyllion and their dominated thralls and enslaved specters are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.</description>

  <description>_These few denizens of a blasted desert waste now huddle in the remains of an ancient city—a city magically scattered across hundreds of miles._   **Once Human.** The ramag were a powerful tribe of dimensional sorcerers allied with a great society of titans, and they were indeed human in ages past. Over time, strange practices warped them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are angular, and a ramag’s hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the width of a human finger. They wear their strange hair tied back in decorative clasps.   **Portal Network.** The ramag used their innate magical gifts to maintain powerful magical conduits, ley lines that crisscrossed the titan’s empire. This mastery of arcane might allowed instantaneous travel to the farthest-flung outpost. The ramag still maintain a network of magical monoliths that connect the scattered districts of their home, but this network is frayed and fading.   **Studious and Powerful.** Although physically weak, the ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural understanding of magic. Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding countryside.</description>

As more rats add to the mass, the creature’s intelligence and force of will grow, and it invariably goes quite mad.</description>

  <description>_Chattering creatures with a superficial similarity to squirrels, the ratatosk have tiny tusks and fur that shimmers in a way that defies the surrounding light._   **Sleek-furred Celestials.** The ratatosk is a celestial being that is very much convinced of its own indispensable place in the multiverse. Its fur is sleek, and it takes great pride in the cleaning and maintaining of its tusks.   **Planar Messengers.** Ratatosks were created to carry messages across the planes, bearing word between gods and their servants. Somewhere across the vast march of ages, their nature twisted away from that purpose. Much speculation as to the exact cause of this change continues to occupy sages.   **Maddening Gossips.** Ratatosk are insatiable tricksters. Their constant chatter is not the mere nattering of their animal counterparts, it is a never-ending celestial gossip network. Ratatosk delight in learning secrets, and spreading those secrets in mischievous ways. It’s common for two listeners to hear vastly different words when a ratatosk speaks, and for that misunderstanding to lead to blows.</description>

  <description>_Ratfolk are the size of halflings, though smaller in girth and quicker in their movements. At a glance they might even be mistaken for halflings if not for their twitching snouts, bony feet, and long, pink tails._   The ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues and tricksters all. Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.   **Adaptable.** Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.   **Fast Fighters.** Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a “Rat King” who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or intelligent undead.</description>

While restrained, the creature is engulfed inside the ravenala's trunk. The ravenala can grapple one creature at a time; grappling doesn't prevent it from using other attacks against different targets. The restrained creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature is compelled to sing a lament of all its various mistakes and misdeeds for as long as it remains restrained. Singing prevents uttering command words, casting spells with a verbal component, or any verbal communication. The restrained creature can still make melee attacks. When the ravenala moves, the restrained creature moves with it. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ravenala.</text>

  <description>_Ravenalas guard tropical forests and watch after local flora and fauna. Their heads are crowned by long-stemmed, green-paddled fronds and spiked seed pods, and their dangling arms end in hooked wooden talons._   **Leafy Advisors.** Tribal humanoids respect and venerate ravenelas, and sometimes seek their advice or magical aid at times of great need. Ravenalas seldom interact with other species unless approached and questioned.   **Prisoners Lamentation.** Unlike treants, ravenalas avoid physical conflict in favor of magical responses. If annoyed, they imprison hostile creatures within their trunks rather than killing or eating them. Trapped creatures must sing their own lament as they are carried off to a distant, dangerous locale. Ravenalas grow to about 20 feet tall and can weigh 1,800 lb.</description>

  <description>_While a huginn’s face resembles that of a great raven or crow, it lacks wings and has a much more solid frame. Most are pitch black, although a smattering have white feathers and red flecks._   The ravenfolk are an avian race of scoundrels, schemers, and sneaks—and they are much more than that. Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory.) He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his spies.   **Odin’s Children.** To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it.   Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, two-handed heavy weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. These function as long spears or quarterstaves in the hands of other races. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.   _**Flightless but Bold.**_ Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 ft. tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95-105 lb. Albino ravenfolk are found in southern climates.   Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.   _**Feather Speech.**_ The huginn have their own language, and they have another language which they may use as well: the language of feathers, also known as Feather Speech or Pinion. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk and not teachable to unfeathered races.</description>

  <description>_This grizzled, weather-beaten creature looks like a sour old man at first glance, complete with scraggly beard. It carries a great pike and wears heavy boots, shod with iron, and the blood-soaked hat jammed on its head is hard to miss. It grins with massive yellow teeth._   **Blood-Soaked Caps.** Redcaps are exceedingly dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name define their existence, and they must constantly be revived with fresh blood.   **Compelled to Kill.** Redcaps aren’t cruel and murderous by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.   **Bandits and Mercenaries.** Most long-lived redcaps are drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through constant banditry.</description>

    <text>50% of rift swine have additional mutant features. Choose or roll on the table below.

1 - Acid Boils: A creature that hits the rift swine with a melee attack must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) acid damage.

2 - Tentacular Tongue: Instead of using its tusks, the rift swine can attack with its tongue: Melee weapon attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled and restrained as with a tentacle attack (escape DC 14).

3 - Covered in Slime:Increase the rift swine's AC by 1.

4 - Acid Saliva: The rift swine's tusk or tongue attack does an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage.

5 - Poison Spit: Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d12) poison damage.

  <description>_This enormous pig is as large as an ox, and its mouth bristles with mismatched tusks. Its body is a lopsided mass of tumorous flesh that gives way to eyes and vestigial mouths, and long tentacles trail from its sides._   From time to time, a breach forms in the fabric of the multiverse, and the Material Plane is bathed in the energy of alien dimensions. Living creatures exposed to this incursion can undergo horrible mutations, turning into monstrous mockeries of their former shapes. One example of this phenomenon is the rift swine: once-ordinary pigs transformed into slavering horrors after being bathed in eldritch light.   **Destructive Herds.** Rift swine travel in herds of 5-8 (and larger herds are possible). Their effect on an area can be catastrophic—they eat nearly anything, possess a fiendish cunning, and delight in the destruction they cause. A rift swine has difficulty perceiving anything smaller than itself as a threat, leading it to attack most other creatures on sight and fighting until it is destroyed.   **Abyssal Meat.** The rumors of vast herds of hundreds of rift swine on strongly chaos-aligned planes, cultivated by the lords of those places, are thankfully unconfirmed.</description>

Its body becomes an avatar of combat, with four legs and a pair of long, heavy arms. In the process, it sheds its skin, becoming entirely undead muscle, bone, and sinew.   **Absorb Weapons.** When risen reavers take form, they absorb all weapons around them. Some of these weapons pierce their bodies, and others become part of the risen reaver’s armament. Their four legs are tipped with blades on which they walk like metallic spiders. Their arms are covered in weaponry infused into their flesh, which they use to crush and flay any living creatures they encounter.   **Battle Mad.** Risen reavers are battle‑maddened spirits of vengeance and slaughter, obsessed with the chaos of combat that led to their own death. They hunt the living with the sole purpose of killing, and they thrive on violence and murder. As they died, so should others die.   **Undead Nature.** A risen reaver doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

They have short, noticeably bowed legs. Hair is unusual among roachlings, but when present, it’s always oily and dark, pressed flat against the skull.   Roachling coloration varies across tan, yellow, dark brown, and black. Regardless of color, their thick, hardened skin appears shiny and slightly oily although it is dry.

  <description>_A barefoot woman with long hair and almost transparent skin sits upon a willow branch. Her hair and clothing are wet, as if she has just returned from a swim. Her smile seems friendly enough._   When a woman drowns, her dripping body may rise again as a rusalka. Some claim the drowning must be a suicide. Others say that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great evil spirit.   **Near Water.** Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died, emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must, however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all night long and inviting young men to join them.   **Songs and Poetry.** Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men, and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.   **Lover’s Walks.** A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.   **Undead Nature.** A rusalka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells, or the victims of a dune collapse. Looking like a shadow stretched out along the ground, a sand silhouette’s erratic movements are difficult to discern._   **Sand Bodies.** If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.   **Traceless Movement.** Sand silhouettes glide through the sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even cautious travelers with their sudden attacks from below.   **Undead Nature.** A sand silhouette doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Stick-thin and moon-faced with a raptor’s eyes and a mane of hawk feathers, this grinning humanoid pirouettes as nimbly as a dancer. Between its long, taloned fingers trickles sand that gleams with the cold light of stars._   **Bringers of Nightmares.** Sandmen are sinister-looking bringers of sleep and dreams. Visiting the mortal world each night, sandmen ensure that their targets slumber deeply and experience vivid dreams that swell the dream realm’s power. Some sandmen develop a talent for a specific flavor of dream; fantasies of lost love or childhood, prophecies and religious visions, or terrible nightmares.   **Abduct Dreamers.** Powerful dreamers attract both the attention and the protection of sandmen: children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes. They protect such charges fiercely but have also been known to abduct them, taking them on wild adventures to inspire yet greater dreams. To them, all dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying. Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by concerns over good and evil.   **Ethereal Dreamscapes.** When not on the Material Plane, sandmen ride bubble-like dreamscapes through the Ethereal Plane, breaching the Sea of Possibilities, nurturing and harvesting its contents. Sandmen are a common and welcome sight in markets across the Fey Realms, elemental planes, and even in Hell—anywhere that dreams or nightmares are a valuable commodity. They are merciless to any who threaten the sanctity of dreams, but especially dream eaters.</description>

  <description>_While they mimic the bleached bones of a desert creature, the bony adornments atop along their backs are part of their peculiar melding of bone and scale._   **Hidden by Sand.** These lethargic, horned, yellow-scaled lizards spend most of their lives underground, lying in wait under the desert sand with their long-necked, spine-tailed bulk hidden below the surface and only the long, jagged bones lining their backs exposed. These bones resemble a sun-bleached ribcage so perfectly that it attracts carrion birds—and curious travelers. When prey passes between the “ribs,” the sandwyrm snaps the rows of bone tightly over its prey. Once its victim is restrained, the sandwyrm paralyzes its meal with repeated stings before carrying it away.   **Torpid and Slow.** Sandwyrms sometimes wait for weeks in torpid hibernation before footsteps on the sand alert it to a fresh meal approaching. To guard against lean weeks, sandwyrms store excess prey in subterranean lairs. They’re not above eating carrion if fresh meat isn’t available. When outmatched in a fight, sandwyrms retreat to their lairs with their paralyzed prety.   **Peculiar Drakes.** Sandwyrms evolved as an offshoot to drakes or wyverns rather than from true dragons; their anatomy suggests they were originally four-limbed creatures and that their forearms are recent additions to the animal’s body. The bones on their backs may have once been wings, so that sandwyrms are the remnants of some primordial, winged reptiles that migrated to the deep deserts.</description>

The host drips blood from its ears, nose, eyes, or from a wound that resembles the injury done to the sap demon's tree (1 damage/ hour). Damage inflicted on the host has no effect on the sap demon. If the host dies or is reduced to 0 hit points, the sap demon must leave the body within one hour.</text>
  </action>
  <description>_When a sap demon leaves a tree, its milky amber fluid oozes from an axe wound on a stout maple’s trunk and shapes itself into a small, vaguely humanoid form on the forest floor beside the tree. This languid creature half walks and half flows forward, implacably following the axe wielder’s path to certain revenge._   **Tree Oozes.** Sap demons aren’t true demons, but rather are intelligent oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or injured. Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is, the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree’s attacker: for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be incorporated into the sap demon’s overall shape. The similarity is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color other than amber.   **Called to Vengeance.** Sap demons can pummel their prey with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent enough to explore the world further.   **Reckless Possessors.** A sap demon can possess another creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is wounded, it’s free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host.</description>

They seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.   **Muddled Origins.** Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.   **Death to Tomb Robbers.** These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.   **Undead Nature.** A sarcophagus slime doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Some dark forest spirit drives them.   **Gnaws Itself.** When there are no other creatures nearby to attack, a savager gnaws on its own forelimbs, resulting in scabs, scars, and calluses so thick and numb that they protect the savager from even the sharpest of swords.   **Rare Meetings.** The only creature a savager won’t attack on sight is another savager. If they are of the same sex, the two avoid each out of self-preservation, and if they’re of the opposite sex, they mate so ferociously that both creatures are left wounded, angry, and hungry. A savager litter contains anywhere from 10 to 25 cubs, all of them born able to walk and fend for themselves. This is important, because within 24 hours after giving birth, a savager mother no longer recognizes her own offspring, and she will attack and cannibalize any that don’t escape on their own.   A savager weighs 1,800 pounds and is 11 feet long.</description>

  <description>_These small, vicious fey look like dirty, lazy dwarves dressed in burlap pants and shirts tied on with dirty twine and frayed rope. They are usually bootless with broken, dirty toenails and wearing rough burlap and leather tams as hats._   **Corrupted Dwarves.** Nicknamed “vanishers,” these small, vicious, dwarf-like fey haunt abandoned quarries and ancient ruins, killing and robbing unsuspecting visitors. Legend says the scheznykis are lazy dwarves corrupted by the shadow fey, though others claim that these are dwarves who swore allegiance to fey lords and ladies long ago. They live in drowned and abandoned mines, tumbledown ruins, and even in the tomb complexes of long‑departed priests and god-kings.   **Magical Hats.** Their shadow fey masters have given them magical hats that allow them to fly and become invisible at will. These hats can be stolen and used by adventurers, but the scheznykis fight hard to retrieve them.   **Arcane Beards.** If an adventurer can successfully grapple a scheznyki, they can attempt to cut the creature’s beard with a magical blade (the beard is AC 15 and has 5 hp). When an attacker successfully cuts off the beard, the scheznyki loses access to all spell-like and spell casting abilities—and the beard hair itself is valuable in making potion inks.   If the scheznyki loses its hat and beard at the same time, it falls into a deep, wasting coma and dies in 24 hours or when next exposed to sunlight. When this occurs, the scheznyki’s body crumbles into dust and blows away one round later. If its beard is magically mended or regrown, or its hat restored to its head before this happens, the scheznyki recovers fully and immediately.</description>

  </action>
  <description>_This grinning humanoid looks like a handsome man, though his skin is black as obsidian, his eye glow red, and he has both insectoid legs and antennae._   **Dark Satyrs.** The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious fauns who have abandoned nature worship, and instead venerate ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.   **Battle Song and Laughter.** Selangs relish battle, pain, and torture—they find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat. Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old gods, their manic speech and alien logic can be hard to follow, requiring an Intelligence check (DC 16) to understand a dark satyr each round. They are most comfortable with the slithering tones of the Void Speech.   **Blasphemous Music.** Their cults and settlements are often found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs use their magic and poison against their foes.</description>

A creature that enters the area of the cone while the musk persists is saturated automatically. A creature saturated in musk is poisoned. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a saturated creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Serpopard musk (and the poisoning) wear off naturally in 1d4 hours. A saturated creature can end the effect early by spending 20 minutes thoroughly washing itself, its clothes, and its equipment with water and soap.</text>

  <description>_These spotted and scaly quadrupeds run on hairless leonine paws, while their cat heads perch atop sinuous, serpentine necks._   **Swaying, Snakelike Cats.** Serpopards are 13 feet long and weigh 600 lb, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable talons. A serpopard’s neck is in constant motion, swaying like a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in unexpected directions.   **Easily Distracted.** Serpopards are foul-tempered predators and scavengers, and are known to occasionally resort to cannibalizing their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their kills—or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.   **Musk Glands.** In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images of these odd animals appear regularly in southern tomb iconography and temple decoration.</description>

Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death.   **Ancient Weapons.** A shabti fights by releasing its serpentine armlets, then using telekinesis against spellcasters while thrashing anyone within reach with archaic but effective stick‑fighting maneuvers. The shabti’s weapon, the nabboot, is a 4-foot stick made of rattan or bundled reeds; this weapon was common in ancient forms of single-stick fighting. Shabti always fight until destroyed.   **Constructed Nature.** A shabti slime doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Often a shadhavar is first noticed for the haunting melody it makes, and some mistake them for unicorns or fey steeds. On closer inspection, they look like desiccated unicorns, their skeletons clearly visible beneath their taut flesh._   **Shadow Horses.** Shadhavar are natives of the plane of Shadow. Although they resemble undead unicorns, they are living creatures imbued with shadow essences.   **Fey and Undead Riders.** While the shadhavar are intelligent creatures, they sometimes serve as mounts for the shadow fey, noctiny, hobgoblins, wights, or other creatures. They expect to be treated well during such an arrangement; more than one unkind rider has ridden off on a shadhavar and never returned.   **Deceptive Hunters.** Shadhavar use their hollow horn to play captivating sounds for defense or to draw in prey. They hunt when they must and are not discriminating about their quarry, but shadhavar primarily eat carrion. Despite their horrific appearance, they are not naturally evil.</description>

  <description>_A mass of shadows and cloudstuff, never touching the ground, a shadow beast may at first look harmless—except for its clawed hands and the glint of its jagged teeth._   **Called from the Void.** Shadow beasts are thought to be the result of shadow fey dabbling in the magic of the void. Almost shapeless and largely incorporeal, through an act of will they can form rough semblances of their old bodies when needed.   **Hate the Past.** The motivations of these creatures are inscrutable. They despise light and anything that reminds them of light or of their former existence. Beyond that, little is understood about them.   **Cryptic Messages.** Shadow beasts are seldom found in groups, but when they are, they seem to have no difficulty or reluctance about operating and fighting together. They have been known to deliver cryptic and threatening messages, but speaking is difficult for them. At times, they perform arcane rituals with the aid of evil humanoids and the use of dark materials. In these rituals they sacrifice magical energies and life blood as well as the tears of innocents and the souls of the damned.</description>

  <description>_Despite being short and squat, this creature’s relationship with a troll is undeniable. The kinship is most notable in the long arms and thick, pebbly hide._   **Long Handed and Toad-like.** The shellycoat is a warped and spiteful creature also called the Iamh fada, or “long hands,” and they are frequently referred to as bridge trolls. Despite being fey, they are distantly related to true trolls. Unlike those tall, lanky creatures, a shellycoat is dwarfish and toad-like, with short, bent, legs and freakishly long arms with swollen, distended joints. It can further dislocate and stretch these joints to alarming lengths.   **Bridges and Pools.** The shellycoat can be found in abandoned wells or behind waterfalls, in deep tide pools, or beneath the ice of frozen ponds, but their preferred haunt has always been under bridges. They are most active during nighttime and on heavily overcast days, because of their mortal dread of sunlight.   A shellycoat's favored tactic is to lie in wait under the water or ice (or bridge) and surprise its prey. It strikes outward or upward from its hiding place to snatch children, livestock (preferably goats), and lone travelers or fishermen. Prey is dragged down to the shadows and water to be robbed and devoured.   **Shining Garments.** A shellycoat will always have fashioned for itself a coat, cloak, or shirt of colored pebbles, glass, and polished river shells. These adornments are crude but beautiful and sometimes magical.</description>

  <description>_A shoggoth is an intelligent, gelatinous blob that can reshape itself at will. Created by an elder race as servants, the shoggoths rebelled long ago and slew their masters without pity. Since that time, they’ve lived in isolated or desolate regions, devouring whatever they encounter and absorbing its flesh into their own amorphous, shifting forms._   **Constant Growth.** When in a spherical form, a shoggoth’s mass is enough to have a 10- to 15-foot diameter, though this is just an average size. Shoggoths continue growing throughout their lives, though the eldest among them grow very slowly indeed, and some shoggoths may shrink from starvation if they deplete a territory of resources.   **Mutable Form.** A shoggoth can form eyes, mouths, tentacles, and other appendages as needed, though it lacks the control to truly polymorph into another creature’s shape and hold it.</description>

They are aggressive enemies of all living creatures and the light that nurtures life. Shrouds blend naturally into darkness, but they stand out starkly in bright light.   **Thin Outlines.** Shrouds look like flickering shadowy outlines of the people they were before they died, retaining the same height and body type.   **Repetitive Speech.** Shrouds cannot converse, but they occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term, or phrase over and over again: something that must have had meaning to them in life.   **Undead Nature.** A shroud doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_These troll skeletons are completely covered in mold and wrapped in flowering vines, and lurk in the shadows of dead tree and profaned groves._   **Black Earth Magic.** Vine troll skeletons guard duskthorn dryad glades and the sacred circles of druids; others serve the vila or even moss lurker colonies as guardians. In each case, they were created by dark earth magic for a purpose, and that energy empowers great strength and endurance—but little in the way of wits.   **Constant Regrowth.** Their vines regenerate quickly, even after they die. Their powerful regeneration allows vine troll skeletons to reattach severed limbs. Only fire or acid can destroy them and render the living vines harmless.   **Bound to a Tree’s Heart.** Vine troll skeletons are direct offshoots of the main vine wrapped around a duskthorn dryad’s tree, a treant, or a weeping treant. Vine troll skeletons are mindless aside from a desire to defend their parent tree, and enchanted troll hearts inside the tree provide their power. Destroying the heart at the center of the tree kills the skeleton bound to that heart instantly.</description>

  <description>_This large vermin moves erratically, leaking noxious fluid from its cracked exoskeleton._   **Ooze Vermin.** This parasitic ooze lives in the shells of monstrous vermin, such as scorpions and spiders, that it has infested and killed. A skitterhaunt creature might be mistaken for its original, living version at a glance, but the sluggish, erratic movements and oozing carapace of skitterhaunts quickly reveal their true nature.   **Wide Range of Prey.** A skitterhaunt infection can decimate whole nests of vermin. When those are in short supply, these oozes move on to prey on other species, such as ants, crabs, tosculi, and sometimes even zombies or reptiles.   **Hosts Required.** Skitterhaunts can’t survive long outside their host creatures; they quickly liquefy and lose their cohesion. A body abandoned by a skitterhaunt is an eerie, hollowed-out husk with a strong, acidic odor.</description>

  <description>_Wisps of humid wind revolve around this spiny ball. Two massive black eyes and a dark mouth are the only features visible through its static straight quills._   **Chaos Aging.** Despite its comical appearance, a slow storm is a creature of chaos, able to visit the pains of old age on the young and fit. It turns the bodies of physically able creatures against them, forcing them to choose between relative inactivity or ever‑increasing pain.   **Surrounded by Wind.** A slow storm is a smaller creature than the space it occupies, and its vulnerable physical body is protected by a cyclonic wind surrounding it. The slow storm occupies a space 15 feet square, but its physical body occupies just the center 5-foot space. The nucleus of a slow storm is a two-foot radius sphere weighing 75 lb. The rest of the space is “occupied” by protective, high-speed wind. Only the central, physical body is susceptible to damage; the wind is just wind. Enemies using melee weapons with less than 10-foot reach must step into the whirlwind to attack the slow storm.   **Static Generator.** A slow storm has no internal organs other than its brain, and it lives on the energy and moisture it drains from opponents. Its quills not only deflect debris but also generate a ball of static electricity that delivers a shock attack.   **Elemental Nature.** A slow storm doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

A swamp adder is quite thin, though it may grow up to 12 feet long and the largest weigh as much as 50 pounds.

  <description>_The dread sons of Fenris are hideously strong and dangerous in their mastery of the arcane. Their acidic breath stinks of death, and they move with a menacing grace.

Although the sons of Fenris are powerful spellcasters, they prefer physical violence, using their spells only if faced with foes they cannot simply tear apart.   **Hibernate Until Ravenous.** Sons of Fenris are creatures of hunger, rage, and madness. They can subsist on infrequent gorging, so they slumber beneath the snow for weeks or months, waking when they grow ravenous or when prey approaches close enough to smell. When hunting, they revel in wanton savagery and destruction, killing entire flocks or herds to delight in blood and to cast runes among the entrails.   **Desperate Worshipers.** Despite their fierce nature, all the sons of Fenris are wise in divine lore, and desperate souls offer them worship and sacrifice in exchange for aid. The sons of Fenris enjoy this adulation, and provide protection, meat, and wisdom to their followers. In some cases, they gather enormous war bands over winter and going reaving in the spring.</description>

    <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become dominated by the spark, as the dominate person spell. The spark instantly enters the target's space and merges into the target's physical form. While inhabiting a creature, a spark takes no damage from physical attacks. The target creature receives a +4 bonus to its Dexterity and Charisma scores while it's inhabited. The speech and actions of an inhabited creature are noticeably jerky and erratic to any creature with passive Perception 14 or higher. Each time the spark uses innate spellcasting, the host can attempt another DC 14 Charisma saving throw. A successful save expels the spark, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the former host. The inhabiting spark slowly burns out its host's nervous system. The inhabited creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each 24 hour-period or take 2d6 lightning damage and have its maximum hit points reduced by the same amount. The creature dies if this damage reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until the inhabited creature completes a long rest after the spark is expelled.</text>

  <description>_This mote of electrical energy floats menacingly, erupting in a shower of sparks and tendrils of lightning. When it disappears, it leaves only the whiff of ozone._   **Born in Storms.** When a great storm rips across a world in the Material Plane, it sometimes tears loose the fabric of reality, releasing sentient creatures composed entirely of elemental energy. Fueled by its frenetic thought patterns and erratic actions, a spark jolts through its new world to find a physical body, drawn by an urge to know form.   **Symbionts and Twins.** Some spellcasters deliberately seek out sparks for symbiosis. Sorcerers or clerics devoted to deities of the elements may reach an agreement with these creatures, allowing them to ride within their bodies for their entire lifetime.   Occasionally when a spark forms, an oppositely charged mate is created at the same time. When this happens, the two always stay within 300 feet of one another. Sparks rarely survive longer than a year, even within a symbiotic relationship with a mortal form. When they expire, they simply wink out and return to the elemental planes.   **Seek Strong Hosts.** When a formless spark senses a potential body approaching, it dims its light or enters a metallic object. Sparks prefer to inhabit creatures with high Strength over other possible targets. Once in control of a body, the spark uses the new vessel to deliver shocking grasp attacks or to cast lightning bolt or call lightning against distant enemies. If ejected from a creature, a spark immediately tries to inhabit another.   **Elemental Nature.** A spark doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

A broken oath, an act of cowardice, or a curse laid down by the gods for a terrible betrayal leaves an indelible mark on a soul.   After the cursed creature’s death, its spirit rises, unquiet, in a place closely related to its disgrace. Compelled by the crushing weight of its deeds, the spectral guardian knows no rest or peace, and viciously snuffs out all life that intrudes upon its haunt.   **Undead Nature.** A spectral guardian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_With black wings and a body pale as alabaster, the vulture-beaked gypsosphinx is easy to identify. As powerful servants of the gods of death and the desert, their riddles and obsessions all hinge on death and carrion. Their eyes can spot prey miles away, and the distance they climb into the sky hides their enormous size._   The pale gypsosphinx shines in the desert sun and stands out in underground tombs and caverns, yet it can conceal itself when it flies in moonlit clouds. Gypsosphinxes are found anywhere bodies are buried or left to rot, and they harvest corpses from battlefields of warring desert tribes.   _**Gossips and Riddlers.**_ Gypsosphinxes converse with intelligent undead, priests of death gods, and with other sphinxes, but they rarely gather among their own kind. They guard their territory jealously, typically claiming a necropolis as the heart of their region.   Like all sphinxes, gypsosphinxes enjoy riddles. They rely on magic to solve challenging riddles they can’t solve on their own.   _**Night Flyers.**_ Unlike most of their cousins, gypsosphinxes are gifted fliers capable of diving steeply from the night sky to snatch carrion or a sleeping camel. The stroke of midnight has a special but unknown significance for the beasts.   _**Foretell Doom.**_ Occasionally, a paranoid noble seeks out a gypsosphinx and entreats the creature to reveal the time and place of his or her death, hoping to cheat fate. A gypsosphinx demands a high price for such a service, including payment in corpses of humans, unusual creatures, or near-extinct species. Even if paid, the gypsosphinx rarely honors its side of the bargain; instead, it turns its death magic against the supplicant, bringing about his or her death then and there.</description>

Immature j’ba fofi pull ordinary spiders into their fellowship in teeming masses that follow along wherever they roam.   **Fond of Camouflage.** The natural coloring of a j’ba fofi, along with its proficiency at camouflage—their hair-like bristles are usually covered in a layer of leaves—makes it virtually invisible in its natural environment. They weave leaves and other forest litter into their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.</description>

  </action>
  <description>_These spiders are named for both the deep red swirls on their abdomens, unique to each spider, and for their peculiar hunting technique. The largest ones hunt in the dark canopy of temperate and subtropical forests._   **Hand-Sized Hunters.** These furry, brown spiders are not enormous monsters, but they are big enough to be alarming. A typical one is as big as a human hand with fingers spread wide, but some grow as large as small dogs.   **Webbed Line.** Line spiders don’t spin webs but instead perch and watch for prey. When prey wanders near, the spider launches a line of webbing to snare it, then pounces unerringly along that line to deliver a deep bite. Their potent venom can incapacitate creatures much larger than themselves, and they quickly devour flesh with their powerful jaws.   **City Dwellers.** Line spiders are often found in cities, and their size makes them a good replacement for a garroter crab in certain forms of divination. They’re favorites among exotic-pet dealers—usually with their venom sacs removed, sometimes not. Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably good pets if they’re kept well-fed. If they get hungry, line spiders may devour other small pets or even their owners.</description>

If the creature wins, it can immediately move 5 feet away from the sand spider. If the contest results in a tie, the creature is grappled (escape DC 15). If the sand spider wins, the creature is grappled and dragged by the sand spider 30 feet into its lair.

  <description>_When a sand spider attacks, its two speckled, tan legs erupt from the sand, plunging forward with murderous speed, followed by a spider the size of a horse.

These carnivores hunt desert dwellers and plains travelers by burrowing into loose sand so they are completely hidden from view. When prey walks over their trap, the spider lunges up from hiding, snares the prey, and drags it down beneath the sand, where it can wrap the prey in webbing before quickly stabbing it to death.   **Spider Packs.** More terrifying than a lone sand spider is a group of sand spiders hunting together. They build connected lair networks called clusters, containing one female and 2 or 3 males. They work together with one sand spider attacking to draw attention, and 2 or 3 others attacking from trapdoors in the opposite direction, behind the skirmish line.</description>

By then, it should be ready to ensnare a new victim.   **Completely Loyal.** This clockwork machine follows orders from its master even if they lead to its destruction, and it ﬁghts until destroyed or told to stand down. The machine recognizes only its creator as its master.   **Guild Tools.** The spider thief got its name because its ability to climb walls and to effortlessly cross gaps between buildings up to 20 feet wide makes it an excellent accomplice for enterprising thieves. Some thieves guilds make extensive use of them, and many freelance rogues use them as partners.   **Constructed Nature.** A spider thief doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_This miniscule creature kicks up a ghostly, sparkling fire when it jostles and jigs. Lightning sparks fly between it and its perch._   **Storm Dancers.** When storm clouds gather over cities, harbors, and twisted badlands, electrical energy fills the air. During these times, miniscule fey dance on church steeples, desolate peaks, and ships’ masts.   Also called corposanti by scholars, spire walkers are nature spirits that delight in grandiose displays of thunderbolts. They can be found frolicking in a thunderstorm or keeping company with blue dragons or storm giants—though these larger creatures often chase them off for being a nuisance.   **Small and Metallic.** These spire walkers stand no more than a foot tall, with dusky blue-gray skin and shocks of silvery, slate, or pale blue hair. Spire walkers prefer clothing in metallic hues with many buttons, and they always carry a handful of tiny copper darts that they hurl at each other during their incomprehensible games. When excited, they emit a sparking glow from the tips of their noses, eyebrows, ears, and pointy shoes.   They play rough-and-tumble games among themselves and enjoy pranking bystanders with frightening but mostly harmless electric shocks. If a spire walker perishes during the fun, the others pause just long enough to say “awww, we’ll miss you” and go through their comrade’s pockets before continuing with the game.   **Love Copper and Amber.** Spire walkers like gold but they love copper. They prefer it over all other metals, and they keep the copper pieces in their pockets brilliantly polished. They also value amber gems. Among a group of spire walkers, the leader is not the cleverest or most ruthless, but the one displaying the most ostentatious amber jewel.</description>

  <description>The star-dwelling, octopoid servants and children of Cthulhu are enormous and strange, with clawed hands, powerful but distended brains, and winglike spines on their backs, with which they propel themselves through the frozen emptiness between stars.   These masters of psychic communication and dimensional manipulation can transport themselves and others across enormous distances.   _**Mastery of Life and Destruction.**_ They’ve harnessed mysterious energies of life and destruction as well, to grow new life with remarkable speed (and some degree of wastage and cancerous tumors) and to turn living flesh into miasmic vapor through nothing more than focused attention.   _**Rituals to Cthulhu.**_ Their goals are simple: oppose the mi-go and aid dread Cthulhu. The star-spawn destroy creatures that will not yield and serve as slaves and sacrifices, rather than allowing them to serve another master. Above all, they insist that all creatures venerate great Cthulhu and sacrifice life and treasure in his name. Their ultimate aim is to bend the heavens themselves and ensure that the stars are rightly positioned in their orbits to herald Cthulhu’s inevitable return.</description>

The stryx have a larger mouth hidden behind their beaks, filled with gleaming human teeth. Stryx range in color from pale gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes._   **Strange Alchemy.** The stryx are unnatural beings that came about through terrible manipulation of normal owls and kidnapped humans.   **The Shadow’s Eyes.** Stryx thrive in the plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied, however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their mad creator.</description>

  <description>_This pale-skinned, white-bearded hermit wears a winter cloak and travels the mountain paths, cliff sides, and trade routes alone._   **Feigns Weakness.** Living in isolated mountain passes and foraging along little-traveled slopes, the stuhac is a master of stealth and deception. Wrapping heavy furs around itself, it poses as a feeble hermit or traveler needing assistance. Only after its victims have been lured away from warmth and safety does the stuhac drop its disguise and show its true nature: the withered traveler's gnarled hands uncurl to reveal jagged yellow claws, its cataract-ridden eyes are exposed as waxen orbs wobbling loosely in their sockets; throwing open its cloak, it proudly shows off woven layers of yellowed tendon and ligament.   **Hideous Garments.** The stuhac’s most prized possessions are its “clutters,” garments woven of layered and tangled ligaments and tendons. These grisly trophies are taken from scores of victims, and stuhacs treasure each bit of their disgusting attire. When two stuhac meet, they compare their garb, swapping anecdotes of their most horrifying kills and deceptions.   Stuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their still-living victims watch. Lying in crippled agony, they cannot flee as the stuhac tears fresh material from their bodies for its garments. To keep screams from disturbing their work, these monsters sever their victim’s vocal chords.   **Devour Victims.** Once its clutters are done, the stuhac feeds on its live victim, devouring everything but the bones. Finding a clean-picked humanoid skeleton along a mountain path is a reliable sign of a stuhac’s presence.   Because female stuhacs have never been reported, some believe that these fiends mate with demons, hags, or lamias. Others believe stuhacs are part of a hideous malediction, a recipe for immortality that requires the subject to devour its own kind.</description>

  <description>_For most of the year the subek are a kindly race, advising others and lending their physical and intellectual prowess to local projects. During the flood season, however, subek become violent and territorial, ruthlessly killing and consuming all trespassers._   **Riverbank Homes.** Subek are crocodile-headed humanoids that dwell along the banks of great rivers. They are tailless, possessing muscular physiques, surprisingly dexterous hands, and a frightening maw of sharp teeth. They are 9 feet tall, average 700 lb., and can live up to 300 years.   During the dry season, subek are friendly, thoughtful scholars, historians, and artisans.   **Flood Fever.** Subek are well aware of their destructive and violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during their time of savagery.   During flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill nonsubek creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded by undeniable, grisly reminders.   **Keep Their Distance.** Despite the danger, subek are tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians, and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns, maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before parting ways.   Subek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with northern trolls, or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul exerting control. A rare few—shamans and oracles, mostly—embrace their duality and choose to live year-round in remote regions far from civilization.</description>

These skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly closed. It takes two actions and a sharp blade to sever the loops and reopen the orifice, and the process causes intense pain and 2 slashing damage. A victim whose mouth and nose have been sewn shut begins suffocating at the start of his or her next turn.</text>

  <description>_These darting creatures resemble dragonflies, but with three pairs of gossamer wings and a body made from splintered wood. Flashes of bright colors run along their bodies._   **Sew Mouths Shut.** Forest folk rarely speak when sutureflies dart through the trees, because these creatures listen for lies and sew any offender’s mouth, nose, and eyes shut. Some say the old woods hide nothing but liars, and that is why the deepest forest is shrouded in silence. Others say that the forest uses sutureflies to smother those who break its covenants or reveal its secrets.   Adventurers see a suturefly’s handiwork more often than they glimpse one of the creatures directly: corpses with mouths and noses stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious children whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.   **Seek Out Curses.** Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black‑banded sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies.   When attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to gain surprise. Once they sew someone’s mouth closed, they target the same victim’s nose, unless threatened by another opponent. Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents’ mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they’re destroyed.</description>

  <description>_A swirling mass of tiny, blue flames dances with the likeness of a skull embedded in each little, flickering fire._   _**Stunted Elementals.**_ Fire dancers are Tiny fire elementals. Speculation varies whether they’re simply immature or somehow stunted. They may be castoffs from larger, fiery elemental beings. A single, solitary fire dancer is no more than a semi-sentient spark with a fragment of life and lofty but unrealistic ambitions. In large numbers, they’re a menace.   _**Unite and Grow Strong.**_ Larger fire elementals are usually sessile creatures, content merely to exist on their plane of origin. Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal qualities—they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands join together, though, the result is an inferno. The likeness of a skull in its flame is an illusion created by the creature, based on how the fire dancers perceive mortal creatures after they’re done with them.   _**Surly Servants.**_ Lone fire dancers have individuality, but in groups, they develop a hive mentality. While this allows them to function as a swarm, it also makes them vulnerable as a group to mind-affecting magic. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters who summon swarms of fire dancers know they must maintain a tight control on the swarm, for these creatures are surly servants at the best of times.   _**Elemental Nature.**_ A swarm of fire dancers doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_These clicking, turquoise-colored beetles have faintly luminescent golden glyphs on their backs, which grow brighter as they draw near._   Manabane scarabs are vermin infused with the ancient magic of fallen desert empires.   _**Devour Magic.**_ Whether from gnawing on the flesh of the undead or nesting in areas rife with lingering enchantment, these beetles have developed a taste for the power of magic even as its power has marked them. The graven glyphs on their carapaces resemble the priestly cuneiform of long-dead kingdoms, and the more magical energy they consume, the brighter they glow, up to the equivalent of a torch.   Manabane scarabs pursue magic without hesitation or fear, tirelessly seeking to drain it for sustenance.</description>

  <description>_A dazzling explosion of multicolored lights erupts from this cloud of flying beetles, flashing every color of the rainbow._   _**Flesh-Eating Beauties.**_ The depths of the jungle are filled with lethal wildlife, and prismatic beetles are superlative examples of this. These flesh-eating, venomous insects distract and subdue their prey with sparkling beauty even as they devour it alive. Individual prismatic beetles sparkle like precious gems in the light; tosculi traders, gnolls, and humans often incorporate their carapaces into decorative jewelry or utilize them as special components in enchantment and illusion (pattern) spells and items.   _**Hypno-Paralytic.**_ When swarming in the thousands, these beautiful bugs create a hypnotic cascade of glimmering hues capable of enthralling creatures. As they descend on their dazed prey, the beetles’ bites slowly paralyze their victims while their toxins distract the mind with feelings of euphoria and delight.   _**Predator Partners.**_ Although carnivorous, prismatic beetles are not overly aggressive; they attack other creatures only when hungry or threatened. Even when they’re not attacking, however, they can be a threat; more than one unwary traveler has stopped to admire what they thought was a docile swarm of prismatic beetles, and became captivated. The unfortunates are often killed and eaten by lurking jungle predator, as such animals know the beetles stun and confuse prey.</description>

  <description>_Some say the sluagh are fey turned by vampires, while others say they are the evil souls of violent men, who cannot rest and return to kill. Still others claim they are the souls of devilbound gnomes who committed suicide. All agree that they are loathsome by nature._   **Cowards Alone.** These tiny, malevolent fey dwell in darkness. Alone they are cowards, but they are rarely encountered alone. They are most active during the winter, especially during winter’s long nights. They usually speak to their victims as they attack, but those shouts are little more than whispers to the ears of their prey.   **Chilling Touch.** Sluagh feed by using their chilling touch. They devour small animals if nothing more appetizing is available. Their victims are easy to identify; their skin is unnaturally cold, and their features are frozen in fear.   Swarms of sluagh serve hags, devils, trollkin, and evil fey who know the blood rituals to summon and direct them. Shadow fey and drow send them against other elves, often targeting the defenders of elven settlements, or their spouses and children.   **Legless Flocks.** Sluagh are tiny, gaunt humanoid creatures the size of a weasel. They have no legs; instead their torso tapers off in a disquieting way. Though they can fly, they can also pull themselves quickly across the ground with their arms. They are always draped in black, though their actual skin and hair are pale white. They have sharp claws and fangs, and their eyes are entirely black. In masses, they somewhat resemble a flock of strange birds.</description>

  <description>_A pack of ghostly wolves appears in a swirl of greenish fog, seeming to coalesce from the fog itself._   When a pack of wolves dies of hunger or chill in the deep winter, sometimes the pack leader’s rage at a cruel death—or the summoning call of a necromancer—brings the entire pack back to the mortal world as a slavering pack of greenish, translucent apparitions that glides swiftly over snow and ice, or even rivers and lakes.   _**Dozen-Eyed Hunters.**_ At night such a swarm can appear as little more than a mass of swirling mist, but when it prepares to attack, the mist condenses into a dozen or more snarling wolf heads with glowing red eyes that trail off into tendrils of fog. A wolf spirit swarm does not eat, but the urge to hunt and kill is as strong as ever.   _**Absorb Their Kill.**_ Most such swarms serve powerful undead, warlocks, noctiny, or orcish shamans as guardians and enforcers, terrifying horses and henchmen alike. The souls of those slain by the pack are said to join it.   _**Howl Before Combat.**_ Hirelings, mounts, and familiars often panic at the sound of a spirit pack’s chilling howl. Packs of wolf spirits are canny enough to always howl for a time before rushing a herd or encampment.   _**Undead Nature.**_ A swarm of wolf spirits doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_Looking like a mix between a large dog and a lion, the creature glares at everyone who passes the threshold of the temple it guards._   A temple dog is an imposing guardian used by various deities to protect their temples. They are fiercely loyal and territorial. Often depicted in temple statuary, the creature has a largely canine body, soft but short hair, a thick hairy tail, and a mane like a lion’s around a dog’s face with a short snout.   **Divine Colors.** Coloration and other features of the temple dog vary to match the deity who created it; sometimes a temple dog’s coloration is quite fanciful. Greenish bronze temple dogs are known, as are those the color of cinnabar or lapis. Even coats resembling fired ceramic of an orange hue have been seen guarding some temples. These unusual casts make it easy for a temple dog to be mistaken for statuary.   **Travel with Priests.** As a temple protector, it rarely leaves the grounds of the temple to which it has been attached, but temple dogs do accompany priests or allies of the temple during travel. The temple dog cannot speak but understands most of what’s said around it, and it can follow moderately complex commands (up to two sentences long) without supervision.   Temple dogs are notorious for biting their prey, then shaking the victim senseless in their massive jaws.</description>

  <description>_Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharp-edged features that seem hewn from ancient stone._   **Children of the Gods.** Ancient titans are the surviving immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.   **Sea God’s Servants.** A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand 60 feet tall and weigh over 20 tons.   **Friends to Dragons.** Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.</description>

  <description>_This giant retains a look of daunting power despite its stooped bearing, tattered clothing, and pieces of slapdash armor strapped on wherever it fits._   **Haunt Ruins.** The degenerate descendants of once-noble titans haunt the ruins where their cities once flourished. They hunt for any living thing to eat, including each other, and sometimes chase after herds of goats or other animals for miles. While they are easily distracted, they always find their way home unerringly.   **Insane and Moody.** Degenerate titans are prone to insanity and unexpected mood shifts. They are fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary as if they were gods. Their lairs are filled with items scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.   **Primal Power.** Degenerate titans cannot command magical words of power, but they have tapped into the earth's latent mystic power to generate strange geomancy. These devolved misfits may have lost most of their former gifts, but what remains are primal powers that tap, without subtlety or skill, into the fundamental building blocks of magic.</description>

Stronger and faster than the giant anaconda, the true king of the rainforest is also more stubborn, fighting off entire groups of hunters and poachers. When stalking prey, these great serpents strike from ambush, swallowing even many dinosaurs in one bite.   **Blinding Scales.** Against groups of foes, titanoboas trust in their ability to dazzle their enemies with the light reflected from their scales, using this distraction to entwine the stunned foes in crushing coils.   **Slow to Mate.** Titanoboas mate rarely. They live for hundreds of years and never stop growing, which makes the need for propagation less urgent. When two titanoboas nest, the result is a brood of a half-dozen smaller snakes (giant constrictor snakes). An adult titanoboa is at least 80 feet long and weighs 6,000 lb. or more.</description>

  <description>_An enormous bronze and iron statue filled with fire towers above the ring of chanting, frenzied worshipers._   Tophets are used by worshipers of fire gods, who toss sacrifices into their flaming maws to incinerate them. A tophet has a large opening in the front where the flames can be seen; sometimes this is an enormous mouth, and at other times it is a large hole in the tophet’s belly. Horns and expressions of anger or wide‑mouthed laughter are common.   **Eager for Sacrifices.** Among fire cultists, it’s widely known that when a tophet’s hands are raised above its mouth, it is demanding a sacrifice to roll down its palms and into its fiery maw.   **Heed Musical Commands.** Flutes and drums can (sometimes) be used to control the actions of a tophet during sacrifices. They have the fortunate side effect of drowning out the cries and screams of living sacrifices.   **Magical Fires.** The fires within a tophet’s bronze body are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don’t require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food, cloth, and (eventually) living creatures to keep them under control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.   **Constructed Nature.** A tophet doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <trait>
    <name>Hive Mind</name>
    <text>The hive-queen is the psychic nexus for every tosculi in her hive. She is aware of the direction and distance to all members of the hive, can telepathically communicate with them when they are within 20 miles, and can sense what they sense when they are within 1 mile of her. Tosculi from her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return. Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover separated members of the hive.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Hive Queen Lair</name>
    <text>on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.

- A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. 

- The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can't move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage). 

the tosculi hive-queen can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>

  <description>The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.   Those few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.   _This humanoid wasp’s gossamer wings beat out a soft, droning buzz. Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and the air around her crackles with arcane energy._   **Center of the Hive.** The hive-queen is the nerve center of a tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive’s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The hive-queen serves as a unifying force. She binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through the hive mind, the psychic web that links all tosculi within a hive.   **Deadly Inheritance.** A hive-queen typically has several immature daughters as her potential heirs at any given time. When she nears the end of her life, the hive-queen selects the most promising of her heirs and feeds her a special concoction. This speeds the heir’s maturation and makes her ready to become a full-fledged hive-queen. The daughter’s first action upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour her mother and all her sisters.   **Hive Chaos.** If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen’s daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.    ## A Tosculi Hive-Queen’s Lair     Hive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP), but nothing else in her stat block changes.    ### Lair Actions     On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: * The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points. * A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. * The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).    The tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.    ## Regional Effects     The region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   \# Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.   \# Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:   **Blood Frenzy.** The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points. If the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days.</description>

  <description>The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.   Those few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.   Tosculi warriors are overseers of work crews and battle groups of drones, directing activities and relaying commands from higher up in the hive mind. They are entirely subservient to the hivequeen’s orders, but if ordered to act independently or to follow their own best judgment, they’re capable of doing so. Warriors are almost never encountered without drones, and tower over them. They stand 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 70 pounds.   **Host Finders.** The warriors’ most important role in the hive, however, is procuring live hosts for tosculi eggs to hatch in. Creatures paralyzed by warriors are brought to the queen’s chamber to have eggs implanted in them. An egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the ravenous larva devours its still-living (but mercifully unconscious) host.</description>

  <description>The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.   Those few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.   Tosculi drones are the workers of the tosculi hive; the smallest, weakest, least intelligent, and most abundant of the wasp folk. Their carapaces are mostly iridescent blue with gold abdomens and lower legs. A drone stands between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weighs around 50 lb. They have only vestigial wings, so they can glide but not truly fly.   **One-Way Scouts.** Drones function primarily as menial workers but, during time of war, they also act as highly expendable scouts and soldiers. Because the warriors know whatever a drone knows (thanks to the hive-queen), a drone doesn’t need to survive its scouting mission to deliver useful information.</description>

  <description>The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.   Those few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.   Tosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow raiders also tower over common tosculi—they stand over 5 feet tall and weigh 130 lb.   **Warband Leaders.** Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider’s life is never thrown away like drones’ or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen, both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen ventures outside.</description>

  <description>_A curious bunny, an abandoned infant, or a delicate songbird can spell slow and agonizing death for the unprepared. Beneath any of these facades may lurk a treacle waiting to feed on a gullible victim, mewling and cooing all the while. Whether by natural selection or arcane tampering, these compact oozes prey on kindness._   **Diet of Blood.** Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat. The treacles’ soft bodies absorb psychic impressions and take the shape of unthreatening creatures. In the wild, treacles assume the form of an animal’s offspring to lie close for several hours.   **Pet Polymorph.** Among humanoids, treacles transform into pets, infants, or injured animals. In the most horrific cases, these oozes resemble children’s toys. Treacles don’t choose their forms consciously, but instead rely on a primitive form of telepathy to sense which shapes a potential victim finds least threatening or most enticing. They can hold a new shape for several hours, even if the intended victim is no longer present.   **Slow Drain.** Once they have assumed a nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they’re in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps or is paralyzed. If threatened or injured, treacles flee. A sated treacle detaches from its victim host and seeks a cool, dark place to rest and digest. With enough food and safety, a treacle divides into two fully-grown oozes. Rarely, a mutation prevents this division, so that the sterile treacle instead grows in size. The largest can mimic human children and the elderly.   Treacles are small, weighing less than six lb. Their natural forms are pale and iridescent, like oil on fresh milk, but they’re seldom seen this way.</description>

  <description>_This twisted tree’s face is made of cracked, black bark knotted into vaguely humanoid features, and thick tears of sap run down its face._   Weeping treants clearly are related to other treants, but they are smaller than the normal variety, little more than 30 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet in diameter, and weighing no more than 4,500 lb. Their gnarled trunks are often twisted, and their wood often groans when they move.   **Forest Wardens.** Weeping treants are protectors of dark, shadowy forests, and they are as long-lived as the trees themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for something specific within the forest—they have no pity for those carrying axes or fire.   **Skeptical Mein.** Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow world, and they’re notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.   **Enchanted Bitter Tears.** Sages and scholars debate why these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with a compelling reason beyond “it’s what trees do.” The weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the matter. Their tears are occasionally components in druidic spells or items.</description>

They often recruit other creatures or mercenaries into their bands. It is not uncommon to see bloodthirsty humans, gnolls, or hobgoblins in a reaver’s band.   **Spirit Talkers.** Trollkin reavers are quite fearful of spirits and ghosts, and listen to their clan shaman and to the word of powerful fey or giants.

This mode of movement takes them almost vertically when they wish, or drifts with the winds. They can reach altitudes of 30,000 feet.   **Shocking Tendrils.** Tusked skyfish catch slow-moving or inattentive prey in their tentacles, and sometimes fish in shallow lakes and streams. They can suppress their natural electrical charge, allowing them to manipulate objects or interact with other creatures safely.   **Slow Mounts.** When fitted with special saddles, tusked skyfish can be ridden without harming their riders, although their slow speed makes them most suitable for casual excursions or unhurried long-distance travel. The jinnborn and genies seem to find them congenial beasts of burden, carrying as much as 4,000 pounds.</description>

  <description>_A sleek serpent wends through the air, held aloft on bronze-feathered wings. The flying cobra flares its hood and hisses, hurling a spray of orange sparks from its fanged mouth._   A uraeus resembles a vibrantly colored cobra. The serpent’s scales are the rich gold-flecked blue of lapis lazuli and its eyes gleam white, but its most distinguishing feature is a pair of feathery bronze wings. It glides gracefully through the air with a deliberate vigilance that reveals its intelligence. A uraeus grows up to three feet long, and weighs around 5 pounds.   **Divine Protectors.** Uraeuses are celestial creatures that carry a spark of divine fire within them, and they thirst for purpose when they arrive on the Material Plane. Whether the creature was deliberately summoned or found its way to the Material Plane through other means, a uraeus is created to protect. Once it finds a worthy charge, it devotes its fiery breath and searing venom to protecting that ward.   A uraeus is fanatically loyal to the creature it protects. Only gross mistreatment or vicious evil can drive a uraeus to break its bond and leave.</description>

  <description>_The eye sockets in a large, ornate death mask suddenly ignite with a golden radiance. With the creak of long-unused limbs, this towering figure in ancient armor raises a khopesh and scepter once more._   **Tomb Servants.** Ushabtis were placed in ancient tombs as servants for the tomb’s chief occupants in the afterlife. They are long-lasting constructs that can tend to physical work and maintenance inside sealed tombs where flesh-and-blood laborers couldn’t survive.   **Slaughter Tomb Robbers.** Ushabtis are most commonly encountered in their roles as guardians—a function they fulfill very effectively. An ushabti is sometimes obvious from the blood of its victims, staining its form. Some tombs are littered with bones of tomb robbers an ushabti has dispatched.   **Khopesh and Scepter.** Most ushabtis have human faces and proportions, with features resembling a death mask. When at rest, they stand or lie with arms folded across their chests, clutching their scepter and khopesh. Many variations have been found, however, including some that are completely inhuman, animal‑headed, or that have abstract or fanciful designs such as a sun sphere head or a body made entirely of papyrus scrolls.   **Constructed Nature.** An ushabti doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

Servants of the land, they are favored by the Vanir, who grant them the ability to curse those who disrespect the wild or ancient laws and traditions.   **Jealous and Wrathful.** A wrathful vættir rises from its mound when its grave goods are stolen (including heirlooms passed on to living descendants) or when they are disrespected (leaving the dragon prow attached to a longship is a common offense, as is failing to make offerings). Vættir jealously guard both honor and treasures, and may be relentless enemies over matters as small as an accidental word or a single coin.   **Dangerous Helpers.** A vættir’s blue-black skin is stretched taut over its bones and sinews and its lips are drawn back in a cruel grimace. A rarer, bone-white variety exists that cares little for material possessions, instead guarding their honor or a particular patch of land. Both varieties will answer a summons by descendants or nearby villages. The summoned vættir will wander into longhouses or taverns and sit down beside those who call them, ready to serve. However, there’s always a price and a vættir’s help is often more than bargained for.   **Undead Nature.** A vaettir doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_These great cats pad noiselessly, while tendrils of smoke drift off their sleek gray coats, leaving misty whorls in their wake. Their eyes shift from dull, pallid orbs to pitch black slits. Their lips curl up into a fang-revealing smile as their bodies fades into fog._   **Split the Herd.** Vapor lynxes are capricious hunters. Devious, manipulative, and mischievous, they toy with their prey before killing it. They rarely enjoy a stand-up fight, instead coalescing in and out of the fog to harass victims. Using their ability to solidify and poison the fog around them, they cut large groups into smaller, more manageable morsels.   **Dreary Marshlands.** Their tactics have earned vapor lynxes a nasty reputation and the occasional bounty on their heads. Additionally, their magical nature makes them valuable to practitioners of the magical arts, and their beautiful, thick coats tempt many a furrier into hunts they may not be prepared for. For these reasons, vapor lynxes avoid civilization, fearing organized reprisal. Instead they haunt marshes and swamps, where the natural fog makes hunting easier. If an intelligent humanoid passes their way, they are happy for a change in their diet.   **Chatty with Dinner.** Although reclusive, vapor lynxes are intelligent, speaking both Common and Sylvan. They are particularly prideful and take great joy in bantering with potential meals to belittle and frighten them. Survivors of vapor lynx encounters invariably mention their constant needling and self-aggrandizement.</description>

    <text>A vesiculosa's heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists (worth 1,000 gp). It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Rootlet Swarms</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa is surrounded at all times by four Medium swarms of Tiny rootlets that move as the vesiculosa directs. Each swarm has a speed of 30 feet, can be targeted independently, has 25 hit points, and (unlike the parent plant) quite vulnerable to fire damage. Other than that, they have the same statistics as the vesiculosa's main body. For each swarm that drops to 0 hit points, the vesiculosa loses one of its Entrap attacks. A destroyed swarm regrows in 24 hours.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Sweet Water</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa's pool emits a sweet fragrance that lures creatures to drink. Creatures that are neither undead nor constructs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to approach the vesiculosa and drink. The water is cool and refreshing but carries a sleeping poison: any creature (other than undead and constructs) that drinks from it regains 1d4 hp and recovers from 1 level of exhaustion, but must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or fall unconscious for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is unconscious for 1 hour. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Verdant</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa's sap seeps into the soil, promoting lush vegetation. At any given time, 3d6 beneficial fruits (fruit, nuts, figs, dates) can be found within 30 feet of the vesiculosa. These have the same effect as berries from a goodberry spell, but they retain their potency for one week after being picked or after the vesiculosa is killed.</text>
  </trait>
  <action>
    <name>Multiattack</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa uses Entrap 4 times, and uses Reel and Engulf once each. It loses one Entrap attack for each rootlet swarm that's been destroyed.</text>
  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Entrap</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa targets a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of one of its rootlet swarms. The target takes 10 (4d4) piercing damage and is grappled (escape DC 15), or takes half damage and isn't grappled if it makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and that rootlet swarm can't entrap another target.</text>
    <attack>||4d4</attack>
  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Reel</name>
    <text>Each rootlet swarm that has a creature grappled moves up to 20 feet toward the vesiculosa's main body. Rootlets wander up to 100 feet from the main body.</text>
  </action>
  <action>
    <name>Engulf</name>
    <text>The vesiculosa engulfs all restrained or unconscious creatures within 5 feet of its main body (up to 2 Large, 4 Medium or 8 Small creatures). An engulfed creature is restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the vesiculosa, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the vesiculosa's turns. When the vesiculosa moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the vesiculosa's main body.</text>
    <attack>||6d6</attack>
  </action>
  <description>_This glittering pool stands among lush and verdant fruiting plants._   **Underground Oasis.** A vesiculosa is a huge, burrowing pitcher plant that dwells in oases, spurring nearby growth and luring in prey with soporific scents and tainted water. A vesiculosa’s body is buried in the ground, with only its rootlets swarming in the open in ropy tangles. It catches meals with these rootlets and drags them to its mouth. Usually these morsels are unconscious, but the rootlets can put up a fight if they must.   **Rich Sapphire Heartvine.** A vesiculosa’s heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists (worth 1,000 gp). It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.</description>

They demand oaths from interlopers and enforce them fiercely. Vila delight in testing the virtue of travelers and tormenting the uncharitable and cruel with bad weather and misfortune. Particularly obnoxious adventurers might suffer bad luck for months because a troop of vila quietly dances around their camp each night.   **Hunt with a Pack.** Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or deer. In combat, they sometimes ride on fleet-footed deer, the better to escape if events turn against them.</description>

  <description>_A pale, scrawny fellow clad in a black leather apron and slender ebon gloves grins from the shadows. A maw of needle-sharp teeth and the wicked straight razor at his side are a clear warning that his enemies should hasten their footsteps._   Vile barbers are sadistic, unseelie fey who move through the shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey can be found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.   _**Fey Punishers.**_ Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies, and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. At the very least, they scar those who have spoken ill of the fey; those who have harmed or murdered the fey are more likely to be bled slowly. Some of these deaths are made quite public—though in a few cases, the victim is enchanted to remain invisible while the siabhra does its bloody work.   _**Slippery Fighters.**_ A vile barber often uses its ability to step through shadows to steal a victim’s weapon and use it against its former owner with devastating effect. Any creature grappled by a vile barber is at the mercy of the barber’s sinister and unclean weapons—they delight in close combat.   _**Assassins and Envoys.**_ Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the siabhra is scant; most adventurers who meet them don’t live to share their findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean.</description>

  <description>_Writhing black tendrils stretch from this indistinct orb of pure shadow. The faintest flicker of something green, like an eye, appears for a moment in the center of the globe and then fades to black again._   **Called from Darkness.** Voidlings are creatures of the darkest void, the cold space between the stars, drawn to mortal realms by practitioners of foul and corrupting magic known to break the minds of those who wield it. They frequently are summoned servants to void dragons, and they have been seen as wardens of the temples on the Plateau of Leng.   **Light Eaters.** They are said to devour life and knowledge and light itself as sustenance; the places they inhabit are known for their dank chill and their obscurity. Voidlings are summoned by those hungry for power at any cost, and—despite their dark reputation—they serve very well for years or even decades, until one day they turn on their summoners. If they succeed in slaying their summoner, they grow in strength and return to the void. Exactly what voidlings seek when they have not been summoned—and what triggers their betrayals—is a mystery.   **Cold Tendrils.** Creatures of utter darkness, they can barely be said to have a shape; they consist largely of lashing tendrils of solid shadow. The tendrils meet at a central point and form a rough sphere in which something like an eye appears intermittently.   Though their tentacles stretch 10 feet long, the core of a voiding is no more than 4 feet across, and it weighs nothing, darting through either air or void with impressive speed.</description>

  <description>_A raven-haired young woman rises to the surface of the water as she swims, singing softly to herself—and her lower body is that of a mountain lion. Her sweet song turns to a yowl of rage when she spots prey._   Wampus cats are all born from an ancient shaman’s curse. Trollkin, orc, goblin, and human shamans alike all claim to be able to transform those who practice forbidden magic into wampus cats.   **Forest Streams.** The wampus cat stalks the shores of woodland waterways, using her magic to disguise her true form and lure unsuspecting victims to the water’s edge. She is particularly fond of attacking bathers or those pulling water from a stream.   **Hatred of the Holy.** While she prefers to feast on intelligent male humanoids, she holds a special animosity toward and hunger for holy men of any kind. Unless near starvation or if provoked, however, she will not kill women. Indeed, a wampus cat may strike up a temporary friendship with any woman who is having difficulties with men, though these friendships typically last only as long as their mutual enemies live. Some witches are said to command gain their trust and keep them as companions.   **Swamp Team Ups.** Will-o’-wisps and miremals enjoy working in tandem with wampus cats; the wisps alter their light to mimic the flicker of a torch or candle and illuminate the disguised cat, the better to lure in victims, then assist the cat in the ensuing battle. Miremals use a tall story to lure travelers into a swamp when the hour grows late, then abandon them.</description>

  <description>_The water leaper is a frogheaded, legless creature with wide batlike wings and a gaping maw. Its shrieks resemble those of a hawk. Its long, sinuous tail tapers and ends in a venomous barb._   **Gliding Wings.** The creature has no legs or arms, but sports a pair of wide, membranous wings. It uses the wings to glide beneath the water, as well as to soar through the air.   **Scourge of Waterways.** Water leapers plague fresh lakes and rivers. The creatures prey on animals that come to the water’s edge to drink, as well as on fishermen that ply their trade in the water leaper’s territory. Stories circulate among fishermen of fishing grounds notorious for broken lines and missing bait, and fishermen give these areas a wide berth for fear of water leapers. Desperate or unwary fishermen who ignore the warnings are never seen again; drifting, empty boats are the only sign of their passing.</description>

  <description>_This hulking primate looms over others of its kind. Its filthy white fur is matted and yellowed, and a deranged look haunts its blood-red eyes._   **Awakened by Sorcery.** White apes were once docile, gentle giants that roamed forested hills and savannah lands. Two thousand years ago, a kingdom of mages awakened the apes, raising their intelligence to near-human level so the beasts could be employed as soldiers and servants, protecting and replacing the humans who were slowly dying off. When the sorcerers died out, the apes remained.   **Arcane Wasting.** The enchantment that imbued the apes with intelligence also bleached their fur white and made them carriers of the arcane wasting, a disease that hastened their creators’ demise. The apes are immune to the wasting’s effects, but they can pass it to other humanoids. Among spellcasters, the wasting spreads like a plague.   **Driven Away.** The awakening enchantment also gave the white apes a strong desire to serve humans, but because of the risk from the disease, they are viciously driven away from settled areas. They are acutely aware of the injustice that was done to them, and generations of exile have turned their loyalty to animosity, especially toward arcane spellcasters.</description>

  <description>_This tiny ball of bright light seems to emanate from a crystalline center._   **Wizard Servants.** Also called a “spooklight,” a witchlight is a wizard’s servant created from a tiny piece of quartz. It appears as a floating ball of flickering light similar to a will-o’-wisp. The hue of quartz used during the creature’s creation determines the color of each witchlight’s illumination. After the quartz is prepared, it is animated through an extended magical ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky. Consequently, they are extremely rare by any measure.   **Flashing Light Code.** A witchlight always shares the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot speak, a witchlight understands Common or another language taught it by its creator. Many spellcasters have taught their witchlights a coded cipher, so it can spell out words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that its trail of light forms letters. This stunt requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check per word.   **Free Roaming.** If the witchlight’s master dies within one mile of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it becomes masterless; it’s free to do as it pleases, and it can never serve anyone else as a familiar. The statistics below represent these independent witchlights.   Evil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o’wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely, good-aligned witchlights guide travelers to places of safety or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides. Neutral witchlights exhibit a playful nature—sometimes mingling inside the cavities of weapons, gems, or other curiosities, which means those items may be mistaken for magic items. More than one “wizard’s staff ” is just an impressivelooking stick with a witchlight perched on top.   **Constructed Nature.** A witchlight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

It moves stooped over, with a shuffling gait, belying its speed and agility._   **Dark Worm Hearts.** Formerly, the suffragans were priests or holy officers of other faiths, but their hearts were corrupted by their fear and loathing. Once pledged to the service of a demon lord, it replaced their hearts with a bulbous, writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to carry on with an undead mockery of life.   **Prey on the Wounded.** They frequent graveyards, casting detect evil or speak with dead to learn who was truly cruel and duplicitous in life. They also follow armies, visiting battlefields shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of nurses or chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead and dying for as long as they remain undetected. In both cases, they cast animate dead to provide the worm goddess with viable skeletal or zombie servants.   **Fear Light and Radiance.** Wormhearted suffragans have a weakness; they are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing power of radiant magic, and for this reason avoid priests of the sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking contagion, infesting their enemies with parasitic worms that devour victims from within. Their favorite tactic is to cast hold person, attack with a helminth infestation, then animate their slain enemies into unlife.   **Undead Nature.** A wormhearted suffragan doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

  <description>_This small metallic globe skitters about on many-jointed legs._   **Cleaning Constructs.** Created by gnomish tinkerers, xanka are constructs whose purpose is cleaning up their masters’ messy workshops. Most xanka are built from copper, brass, or bronze, but gold, silver, and platinum varieties have been seen in the houses of nobles and rich merchants.   Xanka are not built for fighting— their instinct tells them to skitter for cover when danger threatens— but they will defend themselves when cornered.   **Follow Commands.** These constructs only obey simple commands that relate to the removal of garbage. They communicate with each other, but how they do it is unknown.   **Absorb Matter.** When a xanka touches matter with its globular body, it absorbs that matter into itself and breaks it down into energy, so that it can seek out more matter to absorb. Gnomes use them to keep the halls and streets clear of refuse. Xanka can absorb matter equaling half their body size every 6 seconds, but all this absorbing and converting doesn’t alter the xanka’s size.   **Constructed Nature.** A xanka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</description>

The target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or a portion of the xhkarsh's consciousness inhabits its body. The target retains control of its body, but the xhkarsh can control its actions for 1 minute each day and can modify its memories as a bonus action (as if using the modify memory spell, DC 15). The target is unaware of the xhkarsh's presence, but can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours to notice the presence of the xhkarsh. This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends it or the target's fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. A creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours when it succeeds on the saving throw to resist the effect or after the effect ends on it for any reason. A single xhkarsh can seize up to four strands at the same time.</text>

  <description>_Watching with many rows of eyes, this mantis creature strikes with slashing claws and recurved barbs dripping with venom._   **Dimensional Travelers.** The clandestine xhkarsh are beings from another cosmic cycle. Their devices and armor are incomprehensible to—possibly even incompatible with— creatures of this reality.   **Tamper with Fate.** The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe toward their own, esoteric ends—but what those ends might be, only the xhkarsh know.   **Foes of Skein Witches.** Skein witches and valkyries are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and ordinary folk.</description>

  <description>_Ychen bannogs are massive, ox-like beasts with thick, wooly coats and great horns like the gods’ battering rams. They stand over 40 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh hundreds of tons. Despite their awe-inspiring size, these towering creatures are peaceful wanderers in the wilderness, where their calls echo for miles._   **Strongest Beasts in the World.** Legends are built on their sturdy backs. Capable of pulling 670 tons (or carrying 134 tons on their backs), ychen bannogs are the strongest beasts of burden in the known world. Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a ychen bannog at her disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds, haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.   **Ychen Warships.** Giants have a particular affinity with the ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for generations.   **Louder Than Thunder.** When riled, a ychen bannog can bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.</description>

  <description>_One of the rocks suddenly lurches, and rises out of the water. A great eye glides open in the side of what seemed to be a boulder, and a massive, beaklike mouth gapes in the surf._   **Island Reefs.** The zaratan is an impossibly huge sea turtle so large that entire ecosystems develop and grow on its stony, mountainous shell. Drifting on warm ocean currents or settled on shoals, they are often mistaken for small tropical islands. The creature’s head is at least 100 feet in diameter, with a ridge in the center like a tall hill. Its head resembles a massive boulder, and its 200-foot long flippers are mistaken for reefs.   **Ageless Slumber.** Zaratans spend their millennia-long lives in slumber. They drift on the surface of the ocean, their mouths slightly open, and reflexively swallow larger creatures that explore the “cave.” They spend centuries at a time asleep. A zaratan may know secrets long lost to the world, if only it can be awakened and bargained with.   **Deep Divers.** Waking a zaratan is a dangerous proposition, as their usual response to any injury severe enough to waken them is to dive to the crushing black depths. Some zaratan commune with oceanic races in this time, such as deep ones, sahuagin, or aboleth.</description>

  <description>_This swift-moving, lanky humanoid has long arms ending in wicked claws and jaws that open impossibly wide._   **Swift as Horses.** Distantly related to the trolls, the swift and nimble zimwi are a plague upon southern lands. Constantly hungry and illtempered, with the speed to run down horses, lone zimwi have been known to attack large caravans.   **Always Starving.** Most of their attacks are driven by hunger. The stomach of a zimwi is larger than its body, extending extradimensionally and driving the zimwi nearly insane with the constant sensation of emptiness, as though it is starving to death. Because of their endless hunger and low intelligence, zimwi have little awareness of the course of a battle. Losing means only that they have not eaten. As long as they continue to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until death comes to them or all of their prey.   **Stomachs of Holding.** The mage-crafters discovered the secret to turning zimwi stomachs into extradimensional containers similar to bags of holding. Using a zimwi stomach in the creation of such items reduces the cost of materials by half.</description>

  <description>_Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands upright, its spiked tail thrashing from side to side as it walks. A vicious mouth lined with glistening teeth graces each head, and its green scales gleam in the fleeting sunlight._   Hunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two roles—vicious terror and nature’s protector.   **Claws of the Forest.** Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these beasts, while others believe that they have a pact with certain forest druids. Certainly they are clever enough, often destroying bridges, dams, or logging camps infringing on their territory.   **Solitary Hunters.** Zmey avoid their own kind, seeking out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter, but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. The smarter the prey, the better, because zmey believe that intellect flavors the meat. They consider alseids, halflings, and gnomes especially succulent.   **Three-Headed Rage.** Dappled black and green scales cover this enormous beast and its three towering necks are long and powerful. Each neck is topped with an identical, menacing head, and each head is flanked by spiny, frilled membranes. A forked tongue flickers across long pale teeth, and six pairs of eyes burn red with rage.   When a zmey stands upright, it measures 25 feet from snout to tail. The beast weighs over 9,000 lb.</description>

  <description>A zmey’s head doesn’t die when severed from the body. Instead, the head rapidly (within 2d6 rounds) sprouts a stunted body and two vestigial claws with which it can fight and drag itself across the ground. Within days it develops into a complete, miniature zmey, and by the time two lunar cycles elapse, the head regenerates into a full-grown zmey with three heads.   **Constant Feeding Frenzy.** Such rapid growth is fueled by a voracious appetite. A zmey headling eats everything it can, including its previous body, to satisfy its intense, maddening hunger and sustain its regeneration. Many stories about the horrific violence of the zmey are reports of voracious headlings, not mature zmey.</description>

    <name>Call the Blood</name>
    <text>The vampire warlock targets one humanoid it can see within 60 feet. The target must be injured (has fewer than its normal maximum hit points). The target's blood is drawn out of the body and streams through the air to the vampire warlock. The target takes 25 (6d6 + 4) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an equal amount until the target finishes a long rest; a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw prevents both effects. The vampire warlock regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</text>

    <name>Blood Puppet</name>
    <text>The vampire warlock targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be dominated by the vampire warlock as if it were the target of a dominate person spell. The target repeats the saving throw each time the vampire warlock or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to it, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire warlock is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or uses a bonus action to end the effect; the vampire warlock doesn't need to concentrate on maintaining the effect.</text>
